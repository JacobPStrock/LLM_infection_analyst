This section outlines the architecture and functionality of the implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which integrates news data from NewsAPI, user query handling through Streamlit, and response generation using OpenAI's API.

Workflow Description
1. **Data Ingestion and Processing**
        Source: News articles are fetched from NewsAPI.
        Embedding: Articles are converted into vector representations using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) embeddings, which capture the semantic content of the articles for effective retrieval.
2. **Vector Database Storage**
        Storage: The embeddings are stored in a Vector Database optimized for fast and accurate similarity searches.
3. **User Query Interface**
        Interface: Users input queries via a Streamlit-based interface, designed for simplicity and ease of use.
4. **Document Retrieval**
        Retrieval: Upon receiving a user query, the system retrieves the most relevant documents from the Vector Database using the semantic similarity of their embeddings to the query.
5. **Integration with OpenAI Models**
        Contextualization: The retrieved documents provide context to the OpenAI model, enhancing its ability to generate relevant and informed responses.
6. **Response Generation**
        Output: The system generates responses that are augmented with information directly cited from the retrieved documents, ensuring that responses are both relevant and grounded in sourced data.
        System Benefits
        Accuracy: Combines the computational efficiency of FAISS embeddings with the linguistic prowess of OpenAI models.
        Relevance: Ensures responses are contextually relevant by using document retrieval as a basis for response generation.
        Efficiency: Provides quick and reliable access to information through an optimized vector database.
