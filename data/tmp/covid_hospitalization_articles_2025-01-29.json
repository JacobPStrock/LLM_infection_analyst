        "content": "Friends, Tomorrow, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will appear before the Senate Finance Committee for the first of two confirmation hearings as Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.   This is a big deal. Kennedy Jr. is a nutcase and conspiracy theorist with racist tendencies.  If confirmed, he’d have sweeping control over 18 agencies critical to the nation’s health, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In his confirmation hearings, keep your eye on these three big issues:  Kennedy Jr. has assured senators that he doesn’t want to take vaccines away from Americans but just wants to cast more “sunlight” onto the science behind them.  But his history of anti-vaccine advocacy has made those promises difficult to believe. Over the past five years, Kennedy Jr. has repeated over 100 times false claims linking vaccines to autism — a theory debunked by decades of scientific research. He has claimed that COVID-19 was “targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and that “the people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” And that “the Chinese are spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing ethnic bioweapons and we are developing ethnic bioweapons. They’re collecting Russian DNA. They’re collecting Chinese DNA so we can target people by race.” He was a leading proponent of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, erroneously suggesting the vaccine has killed more people than it has saved. In his 2021 book, The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health, he alleged, without plausible evidence, that Dr. Fauci performed “genocidal experiments, sabotaged treatments for AIDS, and conspired with Bill Gates to suppress information about COVID-19.” This is libelous nonsense. RFK Jr.’s misinformation about vaccines continues to endanger public health. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination comes as childhood vaccination rates are falling. According to KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, less than 93 percent of kindergartners had received all of their state-required vaccines in the 2023-2024 school year, compared with 95 percent in the 2019-2020 school year. The secretary of Health and Human Services also shares with the surgeon general the nation’s highest pulpit for speaking about health care. That means that Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vax bias is likely to deter more parents from getting their children vaccinated.  The good news is we’ve largely eliminated these diseases. The bad news is we’ve eliminated the memory of these diseases. So parents are now more prone to worry about the safety of vaccines. Kennedy has opposed vaccine mandates — including those for children to attend schools. He could direct the Center for Disease Control to remove requirements that children receive certain vaccines, and leave the decision up to parents or guardians.  He cold also stop shielding manufacturers and providers of COVID vaccines from legal liability — which would spur a tidal wave of litigation over alleged injuries from the shots. The H5N1 bird flu virus is ripping across America. As of January 16, an estimated 928 herds of dairy cattle in 16 states have been infected, according to the Agriculture Department. Experts worry that bird flu has the potential to set off another pandemic if it were to mutate to spread easily among people. So far, at least 67 cases have been found in people, mostly farmworkers. One person has died from the virus. There have been no documented instances of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the United States, at least so far.  Kennedy Jr. would oversee the CDC, which has managed much of the outbreak and tracked the risk to humans, as well as the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency responsible for managing the nation’s stockpile of flu vaccines, which currently includes two bird flu vaccine candidates.  He’d also have authority over the FDA, which would need to authorize the vaccines before they could be used in people. Given his anti-vax advocacy, there is no reason to trust his judgment on any of this.  If confirmed, Kennedy Jr. would also oversee Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. Taken together, these three programs provide health insurance to more than half the American population.  Many Republicans in Congress want to let expire the subsidies that make Obamacare premiums more affordable. They have also expressed interest in imposing work requirements for Medicaid eligibility. Trump’s nominee to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz, has previously expressed support for privatizing Medicare.  We don’t know Kennedy Jr.’s views on any of this, but I’m wary.  Kennedy Jr. is not just a nutcase. He’s also a designated hitter in the oligarchy’s efforts to get government out of public health — and force Americans to rely instead on private for-profit corporations for their health insurance, hospitalization, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals.  These corporations continue to merge into giant for-profit monopolies and oligopolies.  Recall that Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy for president was supported by billionaire Timothy Mellon — grandson of Andrew Mellon and an heir to the Mellon banking fortune — who donated $15 million to Kennedy Jr.’s SuperPAC. (Mellon was also a major donor to PACs supporting Trump.) Friends, I knew and worked for Robert F. Kennedy. Robert F. Kennedy Junior is no Robert F. Kennedy. Robert F. Kennedy was passionately committed to social justice. He would never have suggested that a deadly virus was targeted at certain races.  In 1962, when Robert F. Kennedy was President John F. Kennedy’s attorney general,  JFK signed the Vaccination Assistance Act in order to, in the words of a CDC report, “achieve as quickly as possible the protection of the population, especially of all preschool children … through intensive immunization activity.” The Senate should reject RFK Jr.’s nomination to be secretary of Health and Human Services.   Share I love the letter that Caroline Kennedy wrote to the senators! She said her father, her uncles RFK and Teddy would be disgusted! Caroline Kennedy did about a 10 minute video on TikTok today saying all of the reasons he should never ever take this position. She was very kind but she was really honest. No posts Ready for more?"

        "content": "Bird Song of the Day  Brown Thrasher, Lake Wales; Bok Sanctuary, Florida, United States. From 1963! * * * In Case You Might Miss…   * * *  Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * *       Trump Administration Energy in the executive: “Trump: We’re Forging A New Political Majority That’s Shattering The New Deal Coalition” [RealClearPolitics]. President Donald Trump speaks at the House Republican Issues Conference at the Trump National Doral Miami Resort: “Together, we’re forging a new political majority that’s shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for over 100 years…. If we do our job over the next 21 months, not only will House Republicans be reelected and expand our majority in 2026, we will cement a national governing coalition that will preserve American freedom for generations to come. There has never been anything like what’s happened in politics in the last few years.” • This, it seems to me, is the name of the game: Party (hence class) power. Presidential power is important, too, but which is more important? Party power, obviously, since without Party power a Democrat Administration could take over in 2028 and use all this “dictatorial” power for its own ends. Credit MAGA and Trump for understanding this, very much unlike the RINOs. (Another sign of Trump’s party leader perspective is the relative youth of so many of his appointments. If Hegseth, for example, doesn’t fall off the wagon or flame out, he’ll be around a long time. Unlike so many RINOs.) “The Strategy Behind Trump’s Policy Blitz” [The Atlantic]. “The staff was still setting up dinner on Mar-a-Lago’s outdoor patio on a balmy early-January evening when Donald Trump sat down. He was surrounded by several top advisers who would soon join him in the West Wing and who wanted to get his input before his attention shifted to his wealthy guests and Palm Beach club members. Susie Wiles, the incoming chief of staff, led the conversation, listing some of the dozens of executive orders that had been teed up for Trump’s signature once he reclaimed the presidency. She wanted to talk about sequencing, according to a Trump adviser present at the meeting, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. How would he like to stagger the orders over the first few weeks back in office? ‘No,’ Trump replied, this person told me. ‘I want to sign as many as possible as soon as we show up.’ ‘Day one,’ he said.’ Indeed. And: “Trump’s ubiquity is also a deliberate strategy, several of his aides and allies told me. Part of the point is to send a message to the American people that their self-declared ‘favorite’ president is getting things done. The person at the Palm Beach meeting and another Trump adviser, who also requested anonymity to describe private conversations, told me that the White House’s flood of orders and news is also designed to disorient already despairing Democratic foes, leaving them so battered that they won’t be able to mount a cohesive opposition.” • Certainly Trump is sending the “getting things done” message; the contrast to the molasses-brained Biden Administration is instructive. But “cohesive opposition” from Democrats? I think Trump’s clear election win foreclosed 2017-style resistance, for good or ill. (Also, a nice example of the interplay between Wiles and Trump.) “Trump’s Dictatorial Theory of Presidential Power – What the Executive Orders, in the Aggregate, Tell Us” [JustSecurity]. “On issue after issue, Trump claims that the Constitution directly empowers him to take certain actions, without any authorization by Congress and in the face of contrary statutes. The idea that the Constitution directly confers certain powers on the President is, by itself, neither new nor controversial. Yet in many of these orders, Trump is not simply asserting an inherent constitutional power to act. He is claiming a power to act in ways that clearly conflict with existing federal statutes. That is, he is asserting a constitutional prerogative to ignore, disregard, or even openly violate federal laws that are inconsistent with his policy agenda. Assertions of that general sort have been made in the past, and it is clear that the Constitution does confer on the President some exclusive powers that Congress may not regulate or restrict. Examples include the President’s power to veto proposed legislation, to grant pardons, to remove high-ranking executive officers he has appointed, and to recognize foreign governments. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. As Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett put it in her concurring opinion in the Trump immunity case, ‘the Constitution does not vest every exercise of executive power in the President’s sole discretion. … Congress has concurrent authority over many Government functions, and it may sometimes use that authority to regulate the President’s official conduct.’ Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion in that case was sloppy and ill-reasoned in many respects, but neither he nor anyone else on the Court disagreed with Justice Barrett on this basic point. Indeed, Roberts relied heavily on Justice Robert Jackson’s concurring opinion in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the steel seizure case. There, Jackson famously emphasized that presidential assertions of power to contravene federal law ‘must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.’ Trump’s recent executive orders would completely upend that equilibrium. He appears to be asserting a roving authority to override or simply ignore binding federal legislation whenever it interferes with his policy aims — regardless of whether the context is one of foreign affairs or national emergency. It is as though Trump is reprising his claim from his 2016 nomination acceptance speech that he alone can address the vital needs of the nation, but extending it to say that he alone has a mandate to suspend the law in pursuit of his goals.” • User tik-tok and birthright citizenship as examples. This is well worth a read (and the fact that material of this clarity is coming from the spook-adjacent lawfare community makes me want to hurl.  “The Problem With a President’s ‘First 100 Days'” [Foreign Policy]. “[T]he contemporary notion of the first 100 days took hold under Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Following an inaugural address in which Roosevelt assured the nation that it had nothing to ‘fear but fear itself,’ he tried to show this principle in practice by confronting the massive crisis of the Great Depression in a proactive manner. Rather than waiting for the crisis to subside, Roosevelt would push Congress to legislate. Coupled with the fireside chats that he delivered on the radio to alleviate national insecurity, Roosevelt was able to move an unprecedented slate of major legislation through Congress.” You can see the parallel to Trump here: legislation vs. executive orders; fireside chat vs media firehose. But: “But the reality is that evaluating presidents through the 100 days framework has always been a limited tool…. Jimmy Carter, who many in the media considered as having an extremely successful 100 days—which included signing the Reorganization Act, which would allow the president to reorganize the executive branch in pursuit of efficiency; and an economic stimulus package that he signed into law 2 weeks after the 100 Days ended—suffered so much during the next few years that his reputation ended up being exactly the opposite of a leader who understood how to move the political needle.”  * * * “Breaking: The Handbasket is first to report catastrophic OMB funding memo” [The Handbasket]. “A copy of the memo from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was provided to The Handbasket at approximately 5pm ET by a source whose anonymity is being protected for fear of professional retribution…. It is a truly unhinged document that sounds like it was written by the world’s most petty 4Chan poster—but then again, that’s who’s currently running our federal government. Here’s the first paragraph to get a feel for it (emphasis mine): The American people elected Donald J. Trump to be President of the United States and gave him a mandate to increase the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar. In Fiscal Year 2024, of the nearly $10 trillion that the Federal Government spent, more than $3 trillion was Federal financial assistance, such as grants and loans. Career and political appointees in the Executive Branch have a duty to align Federal spending and action with the will of the American people as expressed through Presidential priorities. Financial assistance should be dedicated to advancing Administration priorities, focusing taxpayer dollars to advance a stronger and safer America, eliminating the financial burden of inflation for citizens, unleashing American energy and manufacturing, ending “wokeness” and the weaponization of government, promoting efficiency in government, and Making America Healthy Again. The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve. One of the more irritating things about MAGA and movement conservatives in general is that they seem to think that the Frankfurt School and people like Marcuse and his degenerate descendants like Robin DiAngelo or Ibrama Kendi are Marxists. Do you hear the DEI people talking about the working class owning and controlling the means of production? About democratic control of capital? No? On the bright side, “Know your enemy,” as Sun Tzu famously said.  “Top USAID career staff placed on immediate leave” [Politico]. “The Trump administration has ordered dozens of top career employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development to go on administrative leave, according to six people told of the decision…. The decision appears to affect nearly every career staffer who holds a top leadership role at the agency, at least in Washington — around 60 officials, the current and former officials said. The cuts have left many offices within the agency entirely devoid of senior non-political leadership. The entire cadre of leaders who run USAID’s bureau for global health, for example, was put on leave, according to two of the officials. ‘This is a huge morale hit,’ said a former senior Trump administration official who was also told of the move. ‘This is the leadership of the agency. This is like taking out all the generals. I don’t know what they hope to accomplish by it.'” • Insofar as they’re spooks, I’m not crying. “Trump Administration Halts H.I.V. Drug Distribution in Poor Countries” [New York Times]. The deck: “PEPFAR’s computer systems also are being taken offline, a sign that the program may not return, as Republican critics had hoped.” More: “The Trump administration has instructed organizations in other countries to stop disbursing H.I.V. medications purchased with U.S. aid, even if the drugs have already been obtained and are sitting in local clinics. The directive is part of a broader freeze on foreign aid initiated last week. It includes the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the global health program started by George W. Bush that is credited with saving more than 25 million lives worldwide. The administration had already moved to stop PEPFAR funding from moving to clinics, hospitals and other organizations in low-income countries. Appointments are being canceled, and patients are being turned away from clinics, according to people with knowledge of the situation who feared retribution if they spoke publicly. Many people with H.I.V. are facing abrupt interruptions to their treatment. But most federal officials are also under strict orders not to communicate with external partners, leading to confusion and anxiety, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.” “Trump Administration Payment Freeze May Delay Money For Critical Preschool Program” [HuffPo]. “The online system that distributes federal money to Head Start programs is warning providers of upcoming delays, apparently because of the Trump administration’s sweeping review of federal spending. A message about the possible delays appeared this morning, as Head Start providers were logging on to file for their next distributions. HuffPost obtained a screenshot from an official at an early childhood advocacy organization; an official at a second advocacy group then confirmed hearing it about it from providers. The message says that “Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS [the payment system] is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.’ It’s not clear whether the message appeared for all providers nationwide, or just some.” * * * “Trump Ousts Top Labor Board Leaders Who Backed Broader Worker Rights” [Bloomberg]. “Donald Trump is forcing out top leaders of the US labor board, ushering in a swift reboot of workplace law enforcement while testing the limits of presidential authority. Jennifer Abruzzo, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, said she was fired via email late on Monday. Gwynne Wilcox, who was one of the labor board’s two Democratic members, said she was ousted, too. ‘As the first Black woman board member, I brought a unique perspective [good riddance, because what is needed is a universal perspective across the entire working class, which by definition is not unique] that I believe will be lost upon my unprecedented and illegal removal,’ Wilcox said in a statement. ‘I will be pursuing all legal avenues to challenge my removal, which violates long-standing Supreme Court precedent.'” Nice to see that the Democrats have some sort of SWAT Team to rush to her defense. Oh, wait…. More: “Firing Wilcox was less expected, particularly given that there were already enough vacant seats on the board for Trump to install a Republican majority in the coming months.” Remember when the Democrats butchered getting another Democrat on the Board? Why, that was weeks ago! Anyhow, firing Wilcox is illegal why– “Trump fires US labor board member, hobbling agency amid legal battles” [Reuters]. “Gwynne Wilcox, who was appointed to the board by Democratic former President Joe Biden, in a statement called her firing late Monday illegal and said she would pursue “all legal avenues” to challenge it…. Once board members are confirmed, federal law allows them to be removed only for ‘neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.’… The five-member board already had two vacancies, so the removal of Wilcox leaves the agency without a quorum to issue decisions even in routine cases accusing companies or unions of violating federal labor law. Hundreds of cases are pending before the board, including ones involving Amazon.com, Tesla, Walmart, Apple, and dozens against Starbucks as it faces a nationwide union campaign.” • So, no basis for the firing, so far as I can tell. No doubt one can be invented!            Democrats en déshabillé “Confirmed: Unions Squandered the Biden Years” [Hamilton Nolan, How Things Work]. “n constant fear of being crushed by hostile Republican laws, unions have poured billions of dollars into, mostly, getting Democrats elected at the national level. And Joe Biden was as good as this game has ever gotten for them. We just lived through four years of the fruits of this approach. It is not theoretical. We can now evaluate it on its merits…. The real question is: Has achieving electoral political power translated into the growth of union power?… Today, we can definitively say the answer is ‘no.’… In 2024, union density in America fell to 9.9% of the work force. In 1983, union density was 20.1%, meaning that organized labor is now less than half as powerful as it was during the Reagan presidency…. In 2020, union density was 10.8%. That means that over the course of the most pro-union presidency in my lifetime, not only did union density not rise—it declined into single digits. We are losing…. [Organizing] is the responsibility of existing unions and the broader labor movement. That means that unions must spend every dollar they possibly can on new organizing. They have not done this. They did not do it, during the course of the Biden administration. They still are not doing it. As a result—by the standard of ‘increasing the power of organized labor in the work force’—the Biden administration was squandered by organized labor.” • Yep. “Amy Walter: You’re Not Hearing A Unified Outcry Among Democrats About Deportations In Major Cities” [Amy Walter, RealClearPolitics]. “I think the most important thing for Democrats to realize, though, is they’re in the minority. When you’re out of power, you are out of power. And the reality is they now can really just simply react to what is happening based on what Republicans are doing. And their strategy going forward in many ways is going to be a reaction to what the Republican Party did. Four years from now or three years from now or a year from now when the presidential race really begins, that’s when the Democratic messaging really begins. Who do Democrats want to be? What do they want their message to be? We don’t have an opposition party leader in this country like they do in so many other countries. It’s really the nominee of the party who becomes that messenger. And that is going to be a long time from now.” • Another way of saying this is that right now there’s an enormous power vacuum in the Democrat Party. And (a) nobody is stepping in to fill it, perhaps because (b) they would have to bypass the tired and corrupt Democrat apparatus to do it, and in any case (c) the only way forward for the Democrat Party is to abandon or at least put in its place its current base in the PMC, which lacks and has lacked the power to win elections on any principled basis, let alone govern (as Stoller keeps complaining, corrrectly). Three tall orders! “Democrats’ playbook for Trump 2.0: Tune out the noise and focus on economic issues” [NBC]. By all means focus on “economic issues” as opposed to class power for workers. You’re liberals! “Less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a closed-door meeting with Democratic lawmakers to issue a warning and a clarion call. The new administration was going to “flood the zone,” and Democrats couldn’t afford to chase every single outrage — or nothing was going to sink in for the American people, Jeffries told them, according to a person in the room who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Jeffries, D-N.Y., urged members to focus their message on the cost of living, along with border security and community safety. ‘The House Republican Contract Against America is an extreme plan that will not lower costs for everyday Americans,” Jeffries told reporters the next day, referring to the GOP agenda and spending cuts it is weighing. “It will make our country more expensive.”” • Holy Lord, “Contract Against America.” Jeffries keeps his lamp trimmed and burning for Gingrich.

The plane maker closed out a challenging year marked by significant financial setbacks, safety investigations, and a workers’ strike… After the report’s release, Boeing shares initially showed little movement in premarket trading. However, they surged after the market opened, recently trading at $186.49. The stock had entered the day down nearly 15% over the past 12 months.” Manufacturing: “What Investors Found to Like in Boeing’s Tea Leaves” [Wall Street Journal]. “Overall, however, it appears that markets are no longer paying close attention to the minutiae of Boeing’s financial metrics. This is understandable, since brokers themselves are all over the place: 2025 free cash flow estimates range from negative $7.3 billion to a much smaller $1.2 billion burn. No other large commercial-aerospace firm offers such a huge degree of uncertainty. Despite much anticipation, Boeing didn’t provide financial targets for 2025. So what is it that investors like? Executives did say that free cash flow should be positive in the second half of the year as the many parked jets accumulated during years of trouble are finished and shipped to customers. Also, MAX deliveries for January are shaping up to be in the high 30s. With supply-chain constraints easing, the closely watched target of producing 38 MAXs a month is looking achievable this year. Crucially, new CEO Kelly Ortberg has given himself room to maneuver by ending the strike, issuing $24 billion in equity—more than twice what was initially expected—and focusing on quality control both at Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems. ‘The work at Spirit during the strike has really paid off,’ he told analysts Tuesday. ‘That team has done a great job of improving the overall performance and quality of the fuselages.'” Hmm. Concluding: “Investors are correctly looking beyond short-term noise, and hoping that 2025 will be the year in which ‘Mr. Fix-it’ finally puts Boeing on the recovery path. So far, though, this remains a mostly unquantifiable assumption.” • Ortberg soothes the analysts. Mr. Market: “Black Swan’s Taleb Says Nvidia Rout Is Hint of What’s Coming” [Bloomberg]. “”This is the beginning,” Taleb told Bloomberg News in an interview after the close of markets on Monday. ‘The beginning of an adjustment of people to reality. Because now they realize, now, it’s no longer flawless. You have a small little chip on the glass.’ The frenzied selling was triggered by sudden fears that US tech giants may not dominate the field of artificial intelligence as expected. The concerns follow the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has demonstrated a lower-cost approach to developing the technology. Investors interpreted that as a threat to both demand for and reliance on Nvidia’s advanced chips. Taleb said investors have until now been too focused on a single narrative: That the company’s shares would keep rising as it maintains its dominance of AI. Monday’s retreat was actually ‘very little’ considering the risks in the industry, he said.” And: “[Taleb] described technology firms as ‘gray swans,’ because investors underestimate the deviations in their prices that are possible in a day.” • Hmm.

This makes human reproduction analogous to a prisoner’s dilemma. Both father and mother can choose to fully commit or pursue other options. In this context, marriage provides a framework for encouraging, legitimizing, and stabilizing commitment.” This gloom conclusion caught my eye: “The shift from a cooperate/cooperate marriage system, where both men and women made sacrifices to gain the security required for childbearing, to a cooperate/defect one, where men are expected to uphold their end of the bargain in exchange for nothing, has failed. This is the legacy of second wave feminism. Men are dropping out of work or burning things down, and both marriage and children are increasingly relics of the past. We are thereby moving towards a defect/defect system of the kind I described at the start. Men increasingly disdain the daily grind (bewildering public intellectuals, who fail to understand why men won’t respond to market signals). Birth rates continue to decline. And things slowly fall apart. In the event of war, few feel the urge to defend their country. We are in the early stages of the same sort of centuries-long collapse that many civilizations throughout history have suffered.” • Qualified that this is not inevitable (since nothing in history is, I would argue). Class Warfare “Top AI Investor Says Goal Is to Crash Human Wages” [Futurism]. “In a recent tweet, [Marc Andreessen,] the American billionaire investor casually proclaimed that AI must ‘crash’ everyone’s wages before it can deliver us an economic utopia — one that’ll definitely happen, and certainly not create a permanent underclass of have-nots…. ‘A world in which human wages crash from AI — logically, necessarily — is a world in which productivity growth goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero,’ Andreessen wrote. ‘Consumer cornucopia. Everything you need and want for pennies.’ So fret not, lowly laborer: you may be destined for financial ruin, but paradise is right around the corner. Pinky promise.” • “Near,” as in “near zero,” is doing rather a lot of work. If I’ve got zero, “near zero” might as well be on the moon. Or on Mars. “Starbucks staff given ‘panic button’ for laptop lurkers who won’t leave” [The Telegraph]. “Starbucks is to install panic buttons for staff as it cracks down on customers who sit in its shops or try to use its lavatories without buying anything. US workers have been given new guidelines on how to eject customers who stay in the stores for a ‘prolonged’ amount of time, attempt to use lavatories or fill up water bottles without making a purchase, as first reported by Business Insider. The company is also training workers in conflict de-escalation. According to reports, panic buttons have even been installed in a handful of stores in a trial of how best to keep them secure. Starbucks said earlier this month that it would no longer allow customers in the US to use its amenities for free, as part of an attempt by Brian Niccol, the new chief executive, to revive the business… The about-turn comes amid a wider pushback against customers who sit in coffee shops for hours at a time, taking advantage of free wi-fi but not spending more than the cost of one coffee in many cases. As well as preventing shops from making money by turning tables, so-called laptop lurkers have also been criticised for dampening the environment of bars and coffee shops and turning them into less social spaces.” • I seem to recall that the strong coffee-house culture of fin de siècle Vienna was due to a horrid housing situation. If one is looking for root causes. As far as reviving the business, the coffee is burnt and the food is dull. Fix that! News of the Wired Oof. Dad.  I had to google the provinces to get this.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\r\n\r\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. A world in which human wages crash from AI — logically, necessarily — is a world in which productivity growth goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero,’ Andreessen wrote. ‘Consumer cornucopia. Everything you need and want for pennies.’ Wow.  Somebody correct me if I am wrong, but I seem to remember that this procedure — crushing wages => prices of good and services crash => everybody is wealthier — had been postulated a long time ago and was known as “Pigou’s effect”. The idea is of course more than dubious, because nothing guarantees that the profit margin expected by firms will itself crash. If not, then there is no reason why final prices would crash. Just checking: is Marc also taking a pay cut, or is it just the unworthy? After all, his manifestos and briefings already basically feel like they were AI written… My gut reaction was ‘You first, Comrade!’ Me too, except a bit more colorful at that last part. I think you’re right.  It runs against the grain of most everything I’ve ever seen about the impact of deflation on the interrelationship between investment decisions and falling demand.  “Interesting” to note that Investopedia misrepresents the Keynesian critique by herding it into the loanable funds corral: The Keynes Effect holds that as prices fall, a nominal money supply will be associated with a larger real money supply, causing interest rates to fall. This will stimulate investment and spending on physical capital and boost an economy. The implication is that insufficient demand and output will be resolved by lower price levels. Well, if AI turns out to be what he imagines, it would be indeed great, except for one problem: how the cornucopia produced by AI is distributed? There already is sort of cornucopia in the sense that there is no material reason for people being hungry and homeless, it’s the result of rich people hoarding resources so they can have other people on tight lash. So if step one is to crash wages, then step two is him relinquishing control over his billions and companies he owns, and letting AI operated factories to give the products for free, right? Right? This is where open source is crucial, as it makes hoarding by oligarchs impossible. > was known as “Pigou’s effect”. Thank you! Andresseen is the slave of a defunct economist! They would simply redirect the output of the industrial hive directly into the furnaces rather than have it affect price levels. “Credit MAGA and Trump for understanding this” It seems clear that this time around Trump sees winning as not only payback time but also legacy time. Probably his only real reason for wanting Greenland is so he can point to the map and say “look what I did”–nothing to do with strategy. Whereas saving us from the Dems may be legacy enough if Taibbi’s notion of another Church Committee comes to pass. Arguably Biden’s legacy on the other hand is that Trump is once again president. Trump is showing a much greater strategic vision this time around (it’s a low bar, but clearing that low bar also beats the Democrat/PMC opposition). My thoughts on the DEI aspect of the MAGA-PMC civil war. Everybody here is so caught up in the excitement of DEI programs being over they gloss over how the PMC is just moving onto different issues. Trump’s things are America First and also the healthcare tomfoolery with RFK Jr and Dr Oz. That is in response to people’s current issues: lack of jobs and poor healthcare.\nBarbara Ehrenreich defines the PMC as “salaried mental workers who do not own the means of production and whose major function in the social division of labor may be described broadly as the reproduction of capitalist culture and capitalist class relations.” Which is to say, they exist to placate and distract the working class.\nIn 2020 the BLM movement was in full swing. Partially because everybody was out of work with Covid so they had free time to protest. We were also coming off of #metoo i think. The PMC created DEI programs to coopt these movements by placating them with useless programs that did nothing.\nNow people’s biggest issues are lack of jobs. So Trump is blaming foreign enemies for it instead of billionaires profiting off of exploited labor. And we’re currently in the midst of a syndemic – look at Lambert’s covid charts. Plus healthcare companies refusing coverage – look at Luigi Mangione. So the PMC is responding with healthcare wonkery to distract people from the true issues.\nYou cite We Have Never Been Woke in your article. I actually have my copy on a shelf in my dorm right now. Al-Gharbi points out that there’s another subset of the PMC that focused in the opposite of DEI stuff that’s all pro-america symbolism. That’s what Republicans are doing.\nI will restate my point: the PMC exists to placate the working class. The working class is currently not that upset about race and gender things. So they have switched to focusing on employment and health related topics. It’s that simple. I’m not so sure the PMC placates the working class.   Perhaps part of the PMC exists to assure the upper class that the working class is safely placated. Not the same thing as “placating the working class”. I don’t see the USA working class as much influenced by the PMC. I already clocked Musk as a third generation Technocracy proto-fascist. I did not understand until now how completely the classic Technocracy map has infected Trump. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan has said he isn’t running in 2026. He is a D. So that opens up his seat. Gretchen Whitmer has already said she will not run for the empty senate seat. But, Mayo Pete has said he is looking into it. He recently moved to Michgan. He could run for the Senate seat and maybe Whitmer is looking at the big prize. There is also a guy named Peters, who has shown interest for the Senate seat. This is according to my Michigan PMC friends who love them some Big Gretch and especially Mayo Pete. They can have them.\n***\nOn another note, the WH press meetings are quite different. Insurrectiongate babies will be leaders in Congress for decades much as the Watergate babies were. > Insurrectiongate babies will be leaders in Congress for decades much as the Watergate babies were. Well put, and correct. RE:  You’re Not Hearing A Unified Outcry Among Democrats About Deportations In Major Cities Boo hoo.  In addition to Lambert’s tall orders, I will just add that we could have had Bernie Sanders’ entirely reasonable immigration policies designed to protect the wages of US workers AND allow for new entrants.   Pretty tired of all the wailing and gnashing of teeth over deportations, especially given the alacrity with which Martha’s Vineyard denizens rid themselves of busloads of immigrants a couple years ago.   I had a conversation with a businessperson and a member of Congress recently and both decried what Trump might do, with the businessperson complaining about the potential loss of labor in their industry.  I kept my mouth shut about that, and didn’t ask why this businessperson was knowingly employing people who could be deported, and yet didn’t expect to see any consequences for themself. I told both that my guess is Trump will make a bunch of high profile deportations of a few thousand people at the beginning of his term for show, and then move on to something else – he knows the businesspeople do like that cheap labor, even the liberal ones who pretend to be more virtuous.  I may be wrong, but that looks to be what’s happening here.  I doubt it will continue for four years straight, but I guess we shall see… And real estate business people super duper like Hispanic labor although I’m not sure they are paying them less than the native born. At least all the construction I see around here have Hispanic crews. Agriculture and things like meatpacking are probably where the illegals wind up. Trump’s not good at follow through as we know. Could be that’s why he is in such a hurry. The one thing no one ever seems to explain is that, when Trump was prez and had his policies to restrict “immigration” like remain in Mexico or “build the wall,”  vegetables / food, gas, and new houses were a lot less expensive than they are now. I’d imagine that a harvard-trained “economist” could ‘splain how “migrants” in $500 a day hotel rooms in nyc are necessary to keep the price of green peppers “affordable,”  but I just don’t see it. >I’d imagine that a harvard-trained “economist” could ‘splain how “migrants” in $500 a day hotel rooms in nyc are necessary to keep the price of green peppers “affordable,” but I just don’t see it. They would probably tell you that in the city those “migrants” are needed to clean the hotel rooms that paying customers use and thereby keeping up the profit margins of the big hotel chains. Oh, and restaurants, construction sites  and a hundred other businesses… ‘Trump-l’œil’ Hmmm.. I’m trying to see it from your perspective… Is that what a comb-over is called these days? I think some of whether it continues will be based on who he thinks he has to keep happy. Right now he isn’t worried about much of the business community. He is worried about the people who kept him relevant during his time in the wilderness. And they want the migrants gone and the gates closed. I’ve been thinking maybe the deportations are a means to turn the exploitation of immigrant labor from small businesses doing it illegally, to big business doing it legally (as they do in Silicon Valley). Love the map of Bhutan and the province names. Check out the province in the far east of the country. Trashy Gang (Trashigang).\nI love languages. We’ve run some of these down before, but when you ask for a croissant and they bring you an army boot. “I soon learned that everyone in Paris was like that. You would go into a bakery and be greeted by some vast sluglike creature with a look that told you you would never be friends. In halting French you would ask for a small loaf of bread. The woman would give you a long, cold stare and then put a dead beaver on the counter. “No, no,” you would say, hands aflutter, “not a dead beaver. A loaf of bread.” The sluglike creature would stare at you in patent disbelief, then turn to the other customers and address them in French at much too high a speed for you to follow, but the drift of which clearly was that this person here, this American tourist, had come in and asked for a dead beaver and she had given him a dead beaver and now he was saying that he didn’t want a dead beaver at all, he wanted a loaf of bread. The other customers would look at you as if you had just tried to fart in their handbags, and you would have no choice but to slink away and console yourself with the thought that in another four days you would be in Brussels and probably able to eat again.”\n― Bill Bryson, Neither Here Nor There Would the development of DeepSeek be a confirmation of the the observation that  “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.”?

Just as the Obama presidency marked a formal foreign policy design to contain China, as the Wolf Amendment of April 2011 shows, with the effort to undermine a Chinese space program, so Chinese advancement has been fought by America ever since. However, China indeed has an advanced space program now that is strengthening continually and China has comparable programs even through AI. The question is how the Chinese advance is being accomplished.  The answer is academic research and development. Far superior to any well-known US AI tool:  Open source means that anyone who wants it has the code, for free. Anyone who wants to modify it is free to do so. Anyone who wants to delete any code that might potentially let China, the US, or your favorite techbro track them can easily do so. Anyone who wants to can train and run it on their own servers, for free. The servers do not need to be connected to the internet. You can run it on an air-gapped Raspberry Pi for $100, if you want to. Unlike every commercially available US AI engine, everyone is free to deploy their own version, mix it, match it, trade it with their friends. Corporations and governments have no ability to monitor what you choose to do with DeepSeek, unless you allow them to. This is the Linux, Wikipedia, and archive.org of AI. Would it be fair to say that USAI efforts are more akin to a DeepSeep? DeepSleep, perhaps. Buck suck. “This is the Linux, Wikipedia, and archive.org of AI.” Good points, but with regard to this last sentence, one of these things is not like the others in my opinion. Well, it is a model. You can download it and reinforce train it if you wish, but you have to use their research paper to train a new foundation model from scratch if you don’t like whatever China-isms might be included in their foundation model. Still, they’ve provided I think all the information you need to follow their approach for a foundation model, if you have sucked up the Internet as they probably did, for use as a training set, prior to many places getting wise to this and putting up terms of service or technical fixes to prevent such content theft. The approach is just part of it; getting the world’s data is the other part. Not “Far superior to any well-known US AI tool” if you refer to benchmarks.  “Comparable” is more like it. “You can run it on an air-gapped Raspberry Pi for $100, if you want to.”  Sure, if you want to run the 1.5b version of the model.  The full version (which is what gets you to “comparable”) is 671b.  Not going to run that on your Pi box.  The recommended front end (SGLang) suggests using 8 NVidia H200 GPU to run the full FP8 model. “Anyone who wants to modify it is free to do so”.  No, the code is licensed under MIT.  The model, and any derivative model from it, is licensed under DeepSeek’s own license, which reads a lot like GPL but is not identical. > DeepSeek Note the curious offrhyme to “Deep Six.” Some sort of subtle Chinese joke? If India was doing it, it would, of course be called….DeepSikh. I thought DeepSeek come from Deep Thought, which probably came from Deep Throat. Hopefully China will do the same for Google Search. Yandex is already better and China must have good indexing to run the Great Internet Wall .Many people are already trying to use DeepSeek as a search engine but open source doesn’t mean collaborative in all cases. I don’t think we can be so quick and definitive in attributing DeepSeek’s success to Chinese academic research and development prowess, at least until we’ve evaluated IP theft as another hypothesis. . . . of course if the origin story of US LLM’s is IP theft for training data, Open Source of the model after it was expropriated could be a sort of karmic circle. Think what it means that the Nature.com Index of high-quality science research publishing for the latest 12 months shows 4 of the top 5 publishing institutions are Chinese, 8 of the top 10 institutions are Chinese, and 11 of the top 15. Harvard is at number 2;\nGerman institutions are at numbers 7 and 14;\nA French institution is number 11. The rest are Chinese; over and over Chinese. It’s about to get much worse. Now that Trump is requiring that all public and academic research be subject to MAGA комиссáр approval, emptying Federal and university labs, and shutting down Federal data collection and public access that might be inconvenient, expect basic research in the US to collapse. I’m starting to wonder if Trump is actually the Manchurian Candidate. He’s the driving force accelerating global Chinese technical, economic, and political hegemony. If you haven’t noticed already – basic research in the USA collapsed long ago.  We have three huge problems going on among many others. 1)  The sheer amount of just absolutely meaningless drivel, funded by NIH and so many others, has overwhelmed the system beyond belief.   2) The complete takeover of the science and medical publishing industry by corporations that has allowed agenda-based publication and all kinds of conditions on publication; again rendering the vast majority of published work worthless. 3) The recent issues or repeated and overwhelming evidence of complete fraud – in many different universities and researchers, whom had previously been held in very high regard.  Almost all of this is funded by the NIH. Sorry, the “Trump cleaning house” screamers have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. What we have now is a vast corrupt system that is just robbing the national treasury blind.   They are just mad the gravy train is ending.  These types of convulsions have happened repeatedly in medicine.  The last one being the Flexner situation in the 1920s.  There were all kinds of doomsayers back then today.  But after the cleanup, medicine entered its golden age.  It is profoundly difficult for those trying to do good work and the right thing to do their job when the entire system is so full of corruption and malefactors. I have been begging my colleagues for decades to clean it up.  The gravy train was too much for them to change anything.  I also kept telling them if they refused to clean it up, someone was going to do it for them.  And they were not going to like it one bit.  The day of judgement has arrived.  If anyone had told me ten years ago it would be a GOP President I would have laughed out loud, but here we are. So true, the neoliberal “publish or perish” BS has driven a huge amount of publishing drivel just so academics can meet some irrelevant performance metric instituted by some no-nothing administrator. Gone are the days when a researcher would spend years publishing nothing as they worked on the important questions and spent the time necessary for important answers. Then in addition the careerists who chase the government grants and care little for academic ethics. This is one of several older articles in Nature pointing out a real problem with publish or perish: a rush to publish findings where up to 70% of  the test results fail the reproducibility criteria. From 2016: i,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a And a 2015 Nature article: Over half of psychology studies fail reproducibility test https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18248 Also, the publish or perish demand does cause many researchers to submit their older published results repackaged as a new insight on a single part of the older publication.  Publication acceptance is reasonably assured using this method, but new ground in the field is not broken, ground that might take years of research to show meaningful results.  Publish or perish works sort of like a company focusing only on its quarterly profits, imo. Construction Physics talks about how other basic research has declined. https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-influence-of-bell-labs Yes, what IM Doc says.  Times three.  This has been covered here regularly for the last few years.  Earlier today I spoke to medical students who are exploring academic medicine as tutors and preceptors of medical students in their future.  Some will do research.  The topic was the Central Dogma of Alzheimer’s disease (Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis) and how it has led us down one long blind alley for about 100 years. So far, anyway.   A very influential paper on a soluble amyloid protein that was shown to be an early marker for Alzheimer’s was finally retracted last year, 18 years after publication in the world’s leading scientific journal.  Two of the authors disagreed with the decision of their colleagues.  Images in the paper had been manipulated to show something that probably isn’t true. The original data are lost or not available or not in condition to answer the questions.  A follow-up paper, published in 2013 and corrected in 2022, further supported this theory.  The first author (the scientist who did most of the work) on both papers is solely responsible for scientific misconduct in the retracted paper, based on the available evidence.  He did not assent to the retraction, which happened nevertheless.  The one author of the paper who would not respond to editors’ queries according to the retraction notice is a Program Officer at NIH, based on my reading.  Nevertheless, according the the NIH Reporter database, the first author has two NIH grants that add up to $1.3M in total costs to the NIH budget.  Both are on neurodegenerative diseases.  I’m too lazy to look the institution’s “overhead rate,” but based on very long experience the institution takes about $600,000 off the top of that total.  That could explain why this scientist still has a job?  Just asking. This is not a one-off thing.  These Augean Stables desperately need a redirected river.  And like IM Doc, I am surprised how this came about.  But not that it might be happening. >>>The original data are lost or not available or not in condition to answer the questions That is just flaky as heck. But, but… I’m guessing the pretty damn sane concern is MOTIVATION & impact being ignored by a media by, for, about & solely from a wealthy, ofay, INSURED perspective? The rest of us will “fall by the wayside” as only repercussions which affect upscale demographics are of any interest? “Science” to poor folks is largely libertarian think-tank academic sophistry & blatant PhARMA boondoggle hasbara & K Street social-network advocacy solutions firm gaslighting, between PR & marketing churls (probably, inbred NEPO interns) using AI to recycle old campaigns. It’s BEEN about everything BUT “the science,” for so damn long. But Trump’s only interest is “getting his little taste,” like Emilio Barzini; then, shorting those ruined by the churn? Hello, lovely commentariat. Hoping you’ll find this interesting; it’s a piece on the Greenland talk from Peter Theil’s pet publication, Palladium, a journal of “governance futurism”. I’m using some of the information and thinking in it to inform a piece on the sort of veins of international capital, sea lanes and pipelines and railway lines, their ownership, and how they drive events, for my substack.

That said, am I too assume that replication crisis is confined to science as practiced in the West? I doubt it. From the little I know the Chinese have the same problem with honest research as the West and for similar reasons: publish or perish.  There are great incentives including pressure from the leadership to get something, anything, and no real consequences for being dishonest. So, if you want that promotion, be it in China or the West, you best cheat. The only difference between the two is that the Chinese government also pushes for more papers because it is good optics or PR for China and the central party and not just the funding, employment, or promotions for everyone else. Correct all around.  The Chinese have cracked down on scientists who publish in neo-predatory open-access journals in more than a few cases, however. Yes, the evidence is all there in the Harvard Business Review: https://hbr.org/2014/03/why-china-cant-innovate March, 2014 Why China Can’t Innovate\nBy Regina M. Abrami, William C. Kirby and F. Warren McFarlan The Chinese can’t innovate, so how could they replicate?  Which is why the Chinese were repeatedly missing the light side, and finally needed to say they landed on the dark side of the Moon where it is too dark for anyone to check. The barrage of holocaustiana let loose on the internet the past few days strikes me as a last gasp to shame or if you’d prefer guilt the world. It’s along the lines of finding that now 99 year old German who was tangentially involved in a small capacity @ Auschwitz and bring them to justice, or Poland deciding rather all of the sudden that Germany must pay trillions for war damages, what if nobody is still alive to blame in a decade! The fourth turning plays in big time of course, with ramming their holocaust down our throats, while holocausting Palestinians, you can have it both ways! Abba Eban said there’s “no business like Shoah business” which is both a crack he couldn’t get away with today and a hint that Israel’s founders were quite aware of what you are talking about. From what I understand–being a tyke at the time–many Zionists didn’t want to talk about the Holocaust at first and may have even seen Jewish victimization as shameful. Militancy was seen as the antidote. Perhaps when that militancy started to overwhelm the region they felt the need for another antidote. In any case, while it’s undoubtedly wrong to downplay the Holocaust it’s also wrong to downplay all the other holocausts. Consistency matters. That war killed tens of millions, not just six. We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community Another sign of Trump’s party leader perspective is the relative youth of so many of his appointments. This was true of the Federalist Society judicial appointees in Trump’s first term, as well. Many of these judges will be on the bench 40 years after Trump’s second term ends. If Trump pulls his second term off, he’ll have cemented direction and terms of our politics for the next generation. Meanwhile, Biden wasn’t even president for his term, and liberal Democrats only have grift and personal enrichment to show for it all. It’s almost like one party wants to Govern, and the other does not. (Whether either can actually Govern well, is another story, of course, to say nothing of the morals of policies applied.) I didn’t mention it before, but I really like the “In Case You Might Miss…” subheader– this formatting is freakin awesome and much appreciated! Thank you. A request (sorry!): Covid deaths; in context of other leading causes of death, where does it stand? Chart? Here are a bunch of birdsongs, including a cassowary and a kiwi.  Very interesting that the two flightless birds that are the most like dinosaurs sound very reptilian!  I’d never heard their calls before.   Also, I would like a pet kookaburra. I’m not sure your neighbors would, unless they’re miles away. On funding freezes, in my circle this is already causing real hardship today. Friend who just started as a reading tutor with head start was told the program is frozen.  She also may not get paid for last two weeks.   She’s living paycheck to paycheck and this was the job that closed the gap.  Friend who was schedule to get a mammogram can’t complete paperwork because Medicaid portal is down.  I read on CNBC this will be back “shortly”.   The stress and anxiety this causes should not be dismissed.  Another friend who is on a social security disability and requires IV nutrition twice a week is terrified from what they hear from their provider about what services might be frozen.   Normally I would say don’t worry they won’t cut services that will hurt people, but I don’t believe that anymore.   Not sure what path we’re on but the idea of real programs, the kind the average American uses, being suspended for long period of time is giving me COVID lockdown vibes in terms of societal disruption. The real-harms to most of us are certainly accelerating: I often have heard of this expressed in Trump vs. Biden or Democrat vs. Republican terms, but rarely expressed as a systematic crisis: most people are still watching the birdee the picture-show without looking at the overall production itself. Funding for “social programs” (Socialist!!!) and “entitlements” have been getting cut, cut, and more cut since this Gen X has been alive: this is just another round. I’ve been a step or two behind on the ladder of the benefits and opportunities of the American experiment my whole life, being gaslighted by boomers and silents who were living in the past with expired worldview, who are/were living living-dead lives as though trapped in amber, like victims of a Pompei; delusional, denying, suffocating on the ashes of the American Dream. I’m really sad and sorry for the hurt that your friends are now experiencing, but I gotta ask, if you’re only noticing this now, where have you been? This goes way beyond that. It is the early stages of a revolution to see how quickly the Executive can consolidate power and how many things in the federal government can be smashed or broken so they can’t be put back together again. The system wasn’t designed for this type of President to be lawfully elected or for Congress to relinquish its role & responsibilities to him.  The people behind Trump are counting on most Americans to be paralyzed and apathetic while focusing on their own immediate family & friends. The right-wing news ecosystem won’t mention it or its effects. A lot of MAGA supporters will have to find out first-hand. So far, it’s worked because the events have been so chaotic & numerous that people cannot see the larger picture. I warned folks back in the Obamacare early days that Medicaid expansion would end with a nasty rug-pull for the States in the future. All that carrot of “90% federal funding” was always contingent on future Congresses and administrations playing ball.  No Congress can bind a future one to fund anything.  It always has to go through the appropriations process. Looks like the day of reckoning has arrived.  Pay up, States! States are in no position to assume Medicaid funding (or even the bulk of it), but the more significant issue is with institutionalized elderly. In every state, Medicaid is the biggest funder of long-term institutionalized elderly services (e.g., skilled nursing facilities). Many of these facilities, especially the ones that Medicaid recipients dominate, have low margins, little/no cash reserves, and no access to capital markets.  What would governors, including GOP governors, do if their state’s post-acute system collapses? In the United States, there is no alternative infrastructure or plan to accommodate it, and very few people have private long-term care health insurance, let alone the retirement savings to pay for it. Describing the Biden years as the most “Union Friendly” administration of his lifetime…would someone please give him a better quality of airplane glue? In speaking with others, from North to South and East to West, this season all are talking about how windy it has been. Are there charts out there that could confirm or refute this perception, because if there are, I’m not finding them. I’m think that this could be important, so I’d appreciate the help. I was able to find historic data for my location by searching historic wind speeds. I also found a 2022 article that claims wind speeds in Europe slowed from 1978 – 2010 but increased slightly since then. I think wind speeds should theoretically slow down as temperature differentials between latitudes reduces since they are driven by the pole-equator difference. https://e360.yale.edu/features/global-stilling-is-climate-change-slowing-the-worlds-wind I’m not aware of any charts but the National Weather Service does provide daily climate summaries for the U.S. For the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, daily summary data can be found by selecting the desired month/year in the “Daily Weather Observations for the Twin Cities” box. A quick check indicates that this is the windiest January (by only 0.1 mph, though — average 10.3 MPH and bound to go up with today’s gusty conditions) for Minneapolis/St. Paul this century. About Marcuse, et al. It is easy to overestimate many GOP responses by ascribing some coherent approach.\nVoters hear Marcuse, to the extent they have ever heard of him, and group with lefty, progressive, commie and the like as on the fringe and all therefore bad. They don’t make much distinction or dwell on any differences, let alone consider nuances. There is a guilt by association that suffices to put all in one bucket. Polarization numbs. Overwhelmed? Lack of interest in further research? Time preference? Pick a reason as any would do to start. The funding shutdown has all of the landlords who take housing vouchers really concerned here in Chicago.\nI just got an “urgent” email asking everybody to call their congressman to stop this. What it means is that organizations who administer the vouchers won’t get the rental payments Feb. 1st. They won’t have any money to forward to the landlords. Some of the administrators are also landlords and they won’t get paid. This generally means that a lot of landlords and administrators won’t be able to pay their mortgages let alone their employees. That means chaos come Feb 1. While I am not directly involved I feel sorry for all those who count on this program. The collateral damage around the federal funding “pauses” looks to be vast. For instance grants. The bottom line is grants both create jobs and fund salaries as well as support university budgets. I’m hearing that SNAP benefits are on “pause”. Really? That’s intentionally brutal. Has to be.\nI reckon the whole thing will go strong sideways, less there’s a plan for alternative support. There’s plenty of universities and people depend on SNAP in flyover country. Trump needs to be careful not to break MAGA. I see this as the MAGA version of Stalin’s collectivization of agriculture. That’s a reasonable take. I see a judge has put a temporary “hold up a minute” on the freeze.\nInteresting times. So, for those who actively and continue to resist, Trump is going to kill, deport, or send a large number of people to various labor and prison camps? The thing about Trump is that there is no way to predict what he is going to do, or what he is serious about and what is bravado.  One possible interpretation of this executive order is that they freeze everything, and figure out which programs cause people to complain the most, and then they can cut the programs that don’t result in outrage.  But I may be giving him too much credit. . . I hope Trump will prove to be for the Democrats what Deep Seek has just been to Sam Altman, Nvidia, and others: a wake up call to compete. Wassily Kandinsky, Odessa Port\nI was not aware of Kandinsky’s realistic work. That is one heck of a beautiful work of art with a solid composition and terrific choice of color. It’s fun to compare this with images on a search page: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wassily+kandinsky+paintings&t=osx&iax=images&ia=images Thank you for this link. I wasn’t aware of this type of his work either. There seem to be three paintings of Odessa Port, but the reflection of the sky on the water in one almost produces vertigo in me. Transports and makes me soar. “Human Reproduction as Prisoner’s Dilemma” I find it difficult figuring out how to respond to articles like this one.  If a person is religious in a traditional Western sense, then you can get behind virginity until marriage, restrictions on divorce, social punishment for fornication, adultery etc. all the factors you need to enforce the cooperate/cooperate norm that the author feels is beneficial.  On the other hand, what secular person is willing to get behind them-especially for themselves?  Further, the religious person doesn’t support enforcement of these moral norms because of some long-term civilizational benefit after they die, they do it because God will punish them if they don’t.  Maybe some form of secular nationalism could confer some kind of quasi-religious mysticism for the project without fairy tales (the nation as an on-going family), but that seems like thin gruel, especially given the genetic distance between strangers in even homogenous nations.  Again, are the secular persons going to show up for this tent show?  I have my doubts.  You would need some really talented bards at the very least to spin the epic.   I fear the best you can get to is some form of the Platonic big lie to perpetuate beneficial social customs, and yes, perhaps the Catholic Church is the best example, but where does that leave us?   Take your medicine, its false but its good for you?  Not very Faustian for certain.   What else?  Caesarism?  Augustus put in a bunch of socially conservative marriage laws to reform Rome on account of similar problems to those expressed by the author, while completely ignoring them for his own person.  Have we become such children that we need either Sky Daddy or Caesar to compel us to make the right choices?  And why not embrace the decline?  Civilizations rise, civilizations fall, and the decline is usually the most fun, until it isn’t and hopefully we will be dead by then. Apparently Facebook has started blocking any posts about Linux or related subjects: Facebook removing Linux discussions as security threats\nhttps://boingboing.net/2025/01/27/facebook-marking-linux-discussion-as-security-threats.html Which is interesting because Facebook uses Linux, a lot of Linux: Facebook and the kernel\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/591780/ But in Facebook’s defense, I certainly consider FB to be malware so I guess there is a bit of logic to their actions. It keeps showing up on smartphones even after being deleted: Facebook keeps reinstalling itself on my phone. How can I stop this? \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/r7x897/facebook_keeps_reinstalling_itself_on_my_phone/ My U.S. Dept of Labor friend got a “buyout letter” today. They aren’t only going after “DEI” hires but age too. My friend is a white male with a senior role in IT auditing but is 47. They targeted a few other of his older co-workers, too.  No one with half a brain or common sense will accept the RIF. It’s a scam, and they aren’t offering anything. Basically, let DOGE or what Trump group fire you and get more in the process. There is already talk of a class action lawsuit against the federal government for doing this, and I’m sure powerful labor attorney law firms are chomping at the bit.  He’s an older dad, and what is massively screwed up is that the return-to-work policy has created a childcare crisis in the greater DC area. They have called 50+ daycare centers within a 20-30 minute drive. No one has an opening, and almost everyone has a 200+ child waiting list. It’s a clusterf@%#.  Ironically, he was already going three days a week and staying home on Friday. His situation is so dire that he is talking to his 75-year-old parents about moving from Florida to take care of their youngest child (3 years old).  He is a diehard Republican and has no illusions about what he was getting when he voted for Trump again. Still, this entire process is going to turn a lot of the DC establishment against Trump even more, and if he thinks the federal government employees were hostile to him before, wait. When you make it untenable for people and screw with their families & livelihood to the point of forcing them to make dire choices, they aren’t going to like the result.  Vought said during his Senate confirmation that “he wanted people to feel the pain.” He had better be careful that he didn’t get his wish.

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from 1 January 2019 to 1 May 2024 to identify non-overlapping studies evaluating pectoralis muscle-associated index on chest CT scan with clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. Random-effects and fixed-effects meta-analyses were performed, and heterogeneity between studies was quantified using the I2 statistic. The risk of study bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Funnel plots for detecting small-study effects. A total of 9 studies with 4109 COVID-19 patients were included. The meta-analysis findings revealed a correlation between pectoralis muscle parameters and COVID-19 prognosis. Specifically, patients with higher pectoralis muscle density (PMD) exhibited a lower mortality risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92–0.99). The rate of intubation was lower in COVID-19 patients with a high pectoralis muscle index (PMI) (OR =  0.96, 95% CI: 0.92–1.00). In summary, a low PMD is associated with a marginally elevated risk of mortality, whereas a decreased PMI represents a risk factor for intubation in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that pectoralis muscle parameters on chest CT may be a useful prognostic tool for COVID-19 patients.

The ongoing community-wide spread of COVID-19 and its ensuing pandemic ushered in a myriad of unprecedented clinical dilemmas. COVID-19 symptoms range from mild respiratory infections to severe manifestations such as pneumonia, ARDS, hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and fatality. Various COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and mitigating COVID-19 severity [1–3]. Although various COVID-19 vaccines have played pivotal roles in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic to an endemic state [4], the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has complicated the situation, potentially significantly diminishing the efficacy of existing vaccines [5]. In addition to vaccines, various therapeutic options, including monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents, have emerged, yet the strategy for risk stratification among symptomatic individuals to prioritize these treatments remains a matter of ongoing discourse [6,7]. Studies have demonstrated that comorbidities, particularly diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, substantially influence the postoperative prognosis of patients with COVID-19, with these patients having a poorer prognosis than those without comorbidities [8,9]. A reduction in muscle mass is closely associated with the progression of multiple diseases [10,11]. Septic patients with muscle mass depletion and dysfunction frequently experience adverse outcomes during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay [12,13]. Recent research has revealed the incidence of acute sarcopenia among COVID-19 survivors [14], yet the long-term ramifications of both COVID-19 and acute sarcopenia remain unknown. In addition, critically ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients necessitating mechanical ventilation exhibit reduced muscle mass, strength, and mobility during intensive care unit (ICU) confinement [15]. Previous studies have demonstrated that parameters for assessing chest skeletal muscle mass can be derived from the analysis of patients’ chest CT scans [16]. The chest skeletal muscle area can be calculated from CT images at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Studies have reported no significant correlation between the chest skeletal muscle area and mortality in patients with COVID-19 [17]. The relationships between indicators derived from chest CT-assessed pectoral muscle parameters and prognosis in COVID-19 patients remain unclear and warrant further exploration and investigation. This review aims to assess the correlation between pectoral muscle parameters derived from chest CT and the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements [18]. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for eligible studies with no language restrictions. The following search terms were used: “covid-19” or “sars-cov-2” or “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” or “NCOV” or “2019 NCOV” and “pectoralis” or “muscle, pectoralis” or “pectoralis muscle” or “pectoral muscle” or “pectoral muscles” or “pectoralis major” or “pectoralis minor”. The search was updated on 1 May 2024. The focus of this meta-analysis was on the prognostic value of CT-derived pectoralis muscle parameters in COVID-19 patients. Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they were observational cohort studies (prospective, retrospective cohort or case‒cohort); reported hazard ratios or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals; and enrolled patients who tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR and underwent either chest or thoracic CT scans without the use of intravenous contrast medium. Studies were excluded if relevant data on COVID-19 disease outcomes were not available. Publications without original data, such as reviews, editorials and commentaries, were also excluded. Abstracts and conference proceedings were excluded because of incomplete data. Two authors independently extracted data for each of the eligible studies. The extracted data included the first author, year of publication, country, setting, study design, country, sample size, personal and clinical characteristics of the participants, and other outcome variables of interest. Where relevant, attempts were made to contact the authors for missing data. In accordance with the methods of previous studies [19], a line is drawn along the contours of both the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles on chest CT images, delineating the bilateral areas to define the PMA. The PMD was assessed bilaterally on all contrast-enhanced scans, with the mean value then calculated. The PMI was calculated by dividing the PMA by the patient’s height. The skeletal muscle gauge (SMG) is determined by multiplying the PMI by the average muscle density. For the included studies, the Newcastle‒Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis. This scale evaluates bias risk across three domains: study group selection, group comparability, and exposure/outcome ascertainment. Studies scoring below 4 indicate high risk of bias, those scoring 4–6 suggest intermediate risk, and those scoring 7 or above imply low risk of bias. An article was considered to be of high quality if its quality score was greater than or equal to 6 out of a total score of 9. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. Statistical analyses were conducted via RevMan 5.3 software (Copenhagen: Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 2011). For every study, ORs and 95% CIs were used to assess the relationships between pectoralis muscle parameters and the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. We pooled ORs for pectoral parameters employing fixed-effects models, transitioning to random-effects models in instances where heterogeneity was observed. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated via the Q statistic, and inconsistency was quantified via the I2 statistic (0–25% indicates no significant heterogeneity, 26–50% indicates low heterogeneity, 51–75% indicates moderate heterogeneity, and >75% indicates high heterogeneity). Fifty-two records were identified after removing duplicates in our initial systematic search. After title and abstract screening, the full texts of 10 articles were reviewed. One study was excluded because of incomplete data. Finally, 9 retrospective studies that included 3997 COVID-19 patients were included in the systematic review [19–27]. The flow diagram is shown in Fig 1.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316893.g001 Among the included studies, 3 were identified from Turkey across three time periods: Period 1 (March 2020April 2020) [25], period 2 (December 2020March 2021) [26], and Period 3 (October 2021 to November 2021) [24]. All COVID-19 cases were confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing or highly suspected clinically with a COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) score ≥4, ruling out other diagnoses [28]. For all patients with an initial admission diagnosis of COVID-19, a chest CT scan was administered within the first 1 to 2 days of their hospital stay as part of the diagnostic workup. In eight studies [19–21,23–27], a chest CT scan was performed within 1–2 days of hospital admission for all patients with an initial diagnosis of COVID-19. In a multicenter study by Nakagawara et al., the associations between changes in muscle parameters and decreased CT density at 3 months and patient prognosis were analyzed in 167 patients [22]. The baseline characteristics of the patients in the included studies are presented in Table 1.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316893.t001 The PMA was defined as the total bilateral area encompassing the pectoralis major and minor muscles, as described previously [29]. Five studies [19,23,25–27] that reported on the association between the PMA and mortality risk of COVID-19 patients were included in the synthesis, totaling 2104 individuals. The meta-analysis results revealed no relationship between PMA and mortality (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95–1.02), with high heterogeneity (I2  =  64%; P  =  0.02) (Fig 2A). Furthermore, Tekin ZN et al [24]. found that a PMA ≤  2800 was an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients.

This metric provides a standardized way to assess the relative size and development of the chest muscles, taking into account the individual’s overall height [30]. A meta-analysis of 3 studies [19,23,25] revealed that the PMI had no significant effect on the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.67–1.17), with high heterogeneity (I2  =  75%; P  =  0.02) (Fig 2B). Liu Y et al [21]. evaluated the relationship between high and low PMIs and COVID-19 mortality risk and reported that a low PMI was an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients. As the provided OR value could not be combined with the data from the other included studies, it is described separately here. Teigen LM et al. reported that the quantity of the pectoralis muscle is associated with mortality after implantation of a left ventricular assist device [31]. Therefore, four studies reporting the relationship between pectoral muscle density (PMD) and mortality were included in this subgroup analysis. The meta-analysis results indicated that PMD was associated with mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.99), with high heterogeneity (I2  =  71%; P  =  0.01). A summary of the findings is shown in Fig 2C. Nakagawara K et al [22]. found that regardless of sex, a lower CT density of the pectoralis muscle was associated with a greater risk of death. Furthermore, the PMI was multiplied by the average muscle density, as described in the two included studies [19,23], to derive the SMG. The pooled outcome results revealed that decreasing SMG was independent of mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.00), with high heterogeneity (I2  =  91%; P  =  0.00007) (Fig 2D). A meta-analysis of 3 studies [23,25,26] investigated the association between the PMA and the need for intubation in COVID-19 patients. The present study revealed no correlation between PMA and intubation (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–1.00), with high heterogeneity observed (I2  =  85%; P  =  0.03) (Fig 3A).

The meta-analysis results indicated that the PMI was associated with the need for intubation (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80–0.95), with low heterogeneity (I2 =  0%; P =  0.002) (Fig 3B). Combined data from the two studies [23,26] indicated that the PMD was independent of the need for intubation in COVID-19 patients (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79–1.03), with high heterogeneity (I2 =  91%; P =  0.00007) (Fig 3C).

The aim of this study was to assess the associations between pectoralis muscle parameters and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Our research findings confirm that lower levels of PMA, PMI, and PMD are associated with an increased risk of patient mortality. Furthermore, the pooled results indicate that lower PMIs and PMDs are correlated with higher intubation rates. ARDS induced by COVID-19 results in the need for ventilatory support and multisystem damage in critically ill patients, characterized by heightened inflammation, hypermetabolism, and hypercatabolism, primarily affecting the musculoskeletal system [34]. Research by Silva et al. revealed a significant reduction in quadriceps muscle thickness among critically ill patients with COVID-19 during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay [15]. Muscle atrophy in critically ill patients is associated with prolonged hospital stays, extended duration of mechanical ventilation, deep sedation, more severe illness at admission, delirium, and extended periods of bed rest [35]. The degree of decline in muscle mass and function can be used to assess the presence of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia has emerged as a predictive factor for both hospital duration and mortality among critically ill and trauma patients, as evidenced in studies [36,37]. However, the relationship between sarcopenia and the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. Kim et al. quantified the skeletal muscle index at T12 and reported that sarcopenia in COVID-19 patients prolonged hospitalization but did not significantly impact mortality [16]. Feng et al.‘s study of 116 patients revealed no discernible correlation between the paraspinal muscle index at the T12 level and clinical outcomes [38]. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are categorized as having mild to severe disease [39]. Thorax CT is a rapid assessment method that can aid in the evaluation of critically ill COVID-19 patients and is utilized to assess the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 [40]. Branea et al. identified alterations in diaphragm thickness through chest CT scan results in critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [41]. In two recent studies, the pectoralis musculature measured at the T4 level emerged as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19 patients [19,23]. The studies included in this meta-analysis measured pectoralis muscle parameters at the T4 level instead of at the L3 level and examined different pectoralis muscle parameters on chest CT. Chest CT is an important examination for COVID-19 patients on admission, and the PMA, PMI, and PMD can be derived from chest CT parameters. The PMA has emerged as a robust predictor of sarcopenia [42]. Furthermore, research has indicated that decreased PMA and PMI are correlated with adverse prognoses in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [43], lung cancer [44] and unexplained lung fibrosis [45]. PMD has been employed to investigate the impact of muscular atrophy on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients [43,46]. The present study revealed that COVID-19 patients with a favorable prognosis exhibit high levels of PMD. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to mild to severe. Myalgia and generalized weakness have been documented in 25% to 50% of symptomatic COVID-19 patients [47]. Among 214 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, 19% exhibited creatine kinase (CK) levels exceeding 200 U/L (a clinically established threshold for elevation), with a maximum value reaching 12,216 U/L [48]. Patients with abnormal imaging findings demonstrate more pronounced clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities [49]. There are also case reports regarding rhabdomyolysis associated with COVID-19 [50]. The mechanisms underlying the effects of COVID-19 on skeletal muscle are not fully understood, and several mechanisms have been proposed. COVID-19 is associated with substantial systemic inflammation, with a subset of patients exhibiting a severe cytokine response. Elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, have been observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients [51]. TNF-α adversely impacts muscle protein synthesis by reducing mRNA translational efficiency via alterations in eIF-4E availability [52]. In addition, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience extended periods of bedrest and limited physical activity. Research indicates that bed rest is associated with decreases in muscle mass, strength, and aerobic exercise capacity [53]. These underlying mechanisms suggest that exploring the potential associations between body composition and COVID-19 outcomes is reasonable. We acknowledge that this meta-analysis has several limitations. First, the current evidence is limited by the small number of included studies. Second, there was significant heterogeneity between the included studies, which could be due to the quality of the limited number of studies, but further subgroup analysis did not identify the source of heterogeneity. Third, the results are driven by one study with a large sample size. In summary, a low PMD is associated with a marginally elevated risk of mortality, whereas a decreased PMI represents a risk factor for intubation in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that pectoralis muscle parameters on chest CT may be a useful prognostic tool for COVID-19 patients. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316893.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316893.s002 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316893.s003 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316893.s004 (XLSX) For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\n        here.

        "url": "https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/28/trump-trans-military-ban-us-lgbtq/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has promised to ban trans people from the US military, again. (Getty) US president Donald Trump has signed an executive order that lays the ground for reinstating a ban on trans people serving in the military, declaring the armed forces have been “afflicted with radical gender ideology”. The order – which comes alongside other orders eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the military and reinstating military personnel who discharged for refusing to get Covid-19 vaccines – claims trans folks are medically and morally unfit to serve their country where by being trans “cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service”.  On the campaign trail, and following the election in November, Trump vowed restore his previous ban which was which took effect during his first term in office in 2019 but was subsequently overturned by Joe Biden in 2021.  Figures have previously estimated as many as 15,000 people could be discharged from service. Details shared about the order on the White House website on Monday (27 January) state the US military is “the world’s most lethal and effective fighting force” and success requires “singular focus on developing the requisite warrior ethos, and the pursuit of military excellence cannot be diluted to accommodate political agendas or other ideologies harmful to unit cohesion”.  It goes on to claim the military has been “afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists” and certain mental and physical health conditions are “incompatible with active duty”, including “conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders, eating disorders, suicidality, and prior psychiatric hospitalization”. The order also said “expressing a false “gender identity” divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service” – echoing the new US government policy signed-in on the day of Trump’s inauguration that there are “only two genders – male and female”.  “Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” his order reads. “A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.” The order added that military service is “must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty”.  You may like to watch “The Armed Forces must adhere to high mental and physical health standards to ensure our military can deploy, fight, and win, including in austere conditions and without the benefit of routine medical treatment or special provisions,” it said.  “Unit cohesion requires high levels of integrity and stability among service members,” states a fact sheet for Monday’s order. “It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the use of heavy narcotics.” Prior to the order being issued, anti-woke stalwart Pete Hegseth – who was sworn in as secretary of defense on Saturday – promised reporters outside the Pentagon there were “more executive orders coming”.  “On removing DEI inside the Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of Covid mandates, iron dome for America — this is happening quickly, and as the secretary of defense, it’s an honour to salute smartly as I did as a junior officer and now as the secretary of defense to ensure these orders are complied with rapidly and quickly,” he said.  In response, LGBTQ+ groups have said they will take action over the order.  In a joint statement to The Independent, Lambda Legal and Human Rights Campaign said: “We have been here before and seven years ago were able to successfully block the earlier administration’s effort to prevent patriotic, talented Americans from serving their country. “Not only is such a move cruel, it compromises the safety and security of our country and is particularly dangerous and wrong.

        "title": "A Raw Milk Magnate Has Spent Years Fighting Public Health Agencies. Will RFK Jr. Take His Side?",
        "url": "https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/raw-farm-raw-milk-mark-mcafee/",
        "content": "Mother Jones illustration; Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Zuma  In December, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department reported that five house cats had died after drinking raw milk. Four of their bodies subsequently tested positive for H5N1, the bird flu virus. But Cindy, a sleek gray tabby, is feeling fine, according to Mark McAfee, founder and CEO of Raw Farm, the farm where Cindy spends her days.   While Raw Farm does produce raw milk and cheese—including the milk allegedly given to the dead cats—the Fresno-based dairy has gone beyond retail to position itself as one of the biggest players in the raw milk universe, intent on proving its health benefits, spreading its gospel, and firing back against its detractors.  The dead cats are hardly the first time McAfee’s products have been linked to the spread of disease. These are heady times for McAfee. Raw milk is an intensely visible part of the online ecosystem, with influencers singing its praises and downplaying the risks of unpasteurized dairy. In natural and holistic health spaces, it is viewed not just as a holy grail product, but also as a symbol of how many of its drinkers would like to see themselves: rugged, unafraid, and not averse to owning the libs. In November, raw milk fan Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who McAfee says is a longtime customer, was tapped by Donald Trump to run the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Food and Drug Administration. If Kennedy’s nomination goes through, McAfee may serve a role in shaping the country’s raw milk policy.  McAfee has an obvious passion for his work, a missionary zeal, and an ability to quickly cite studies that he claims prove raw milk’s miraculous benefits. He likes, for instance, to point to research suggesting that kids living on farms in Europe develop lifelong protective mechanisms against asthma. (The FDA says raw milk advocates have long “misused” the study and are conflating raw milk with farm milk, a conclusion McAfee and the experts he cites disagree with.) Moments after we first connected on the phone, he said raw milk “makes asthma go away,” something he also told Mother Jones in 2012. I asked him if he was making a medical claim about his products, as the FDA has told Raw Farm not to do on its labels or social media. “I can make a medical claim on your platform,” he replied serenely. “Not on mine.” But for all McAfee’s talk of health benefits, the dead cats are hardly the first time his products have been linked to the spread of disease and endured government scrutiny.  The cases stretch back to when Raw Farm was called Organic Pastures. (The company changed its name in 2020, it says, “to reflect our RAW values and standards.”) In 2008, McAfee and Organic Pastures resolved a federal criminal case by pleading guilty to two misdemeanor counts related to the interstate sale of misbranded food. According to their agreement with prosecutors, McAfee and the company admitted to shipping products labeled as “pet food” despite knowing they were for human consumption. In the summer of 2023, Raw Farm entered into a consent decree with federal prosecutors to resolve charges that the company had violated an order stemming from the case prohibiting it from shipping milk intended for human consumption across state lines. Until at least 2028, the settlement allows the FDA to make unannounced inspections and imposes audits and outside review of Raw Farm’s claims on its products and on social media.   McAfee says the farm has “been fully compliant” with the FDA’s interstate commerce rules, but still complains about what he views as unfair targeting by the agency.  “The consent decree and this entire thing puts me under their thumb,” McAfee says, “so that I get specialized treatment that nobody else gets.” Since the 1930s, most milk sold across the country has been pasteurized, especially after it was discovered that raw milk could transmit tuberculosis. The roots of today’s raw milk cause go back about as far, to a dentist named Weston A. Price, who traveled the world on a self-styled study of traditional food cultures. “Price made a whirlwind tour of primitive areas,” explains one critical physician, “examined the natives superficially, and jumped to simplistic conclusions”—broadly, that Indigenous people were healthy because they didn’t eat a Western diet composed of flour, sugar, and pasteurized foods. The fight over whether raw milk was better and healthier, particularly for children, continued to crop up in American life. A 1950 pamphlet from an outfit calling itself the National Nutrition League held that “protective qualities” in raw milk were stripped in the pasteurization process—functionally the same argument that McAfee and other raw milk proponents make today. “In the best interest of every child, infant and adult the first requisite is pure raw milk,” the pamphlet added, “carefully supervised as to bacterial count.”  In 1987, a new FDA regulation formally prohibited the interstate sale of raw milk. In the wake of the agency’s action, the libertarian “health freedom” movement, which advocates for fewer government regulations in food and medicine, also took on the restrictions.  Nonprofits and special interest groups sprang up to promote the cause: In 1999, a nutrition enthusiast named Sally Fallon Morell founded the Weston A. Price Foundation, which says it supports “wise traditions in food, farming, and the healing arts.” In practice, that has meant advocating for the legalization of raw milk, greater consumption of animal fats, and a ban on soy infant formula. (In furthering its agenda, the organization has also sometimes pushed pseudoscience: Fallon Morell wrote in 2022 that she believed she contracted Covid after exposure to wifi and 5G technology; another article in the group’s house publication Wise Traditions calls Covid vaccines “bioweapons.”)    Raw milk advocacy has been incredibly successful, with sales legal in 43 states. On the Fourth of July in 2007, Fallon Morell began forming a new legal architecture to advance raw milk, helping found the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, which provides legal advice to farmers and which set a goal, she wrote, “to make raw milk sales legal in every state.” In 2011, Liz Reitzig, who helped popularize raw milk buying clubs as a way to help members make purchases despite legal restrictions, took part in launching the Farm Food Freedom Coalition, which sponsored the Raw Milk Freedom Riders, a caravan of self-described frustrated mothers who wanted the repeal of federal raw milk laws.  All this advocacy has been incredibly successful. Raw milk is now legal to sell in some way in 43 states, and every time a raw milk advocate faces trouble, a huge fundraising and legal apparatus comes to their aid. Take Amos Miller, a Pennsylvania Amish farmer whose farm was raided in January 2024, a decade after the farm was linked by the FDA to a deadly listeria outbreak, after which he refused to obtain state permits to sell raw milk. As Miller’s fight continues, he was greeted with a huge show of support from both the raw milk community and right-wing and libertarian figures; he’s also raised more than $300,000 on the Christian fundraising platform GiveSendGo.   In the fall of 2006, Mary McGonigle-Martin walked into a natural foods store in Temecula, California, and saw a dairy aisle banner advertising Organic Pastures. At the time, her son Chris, who was 7, was grappling with ADHD and head congestion that wouldn’t go away. She didn’t want to put him on “stimulant medication,” she says; from her own time working at a vitamin store in her 20s, she trusted solutions that felt more natural.  “I went, ‘Oh, that’s right, raw milk is healthier,’” she says. “I would’ve never gone looking for this.”  McGonigle-Martin says she bought raw milk for Chris just three times, but the third bottle was contaminated with E. coli. Soon, he was very sick, developing, as a subsequent lawsuit detailed, a blood and kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Today, McGonigle-Martin, a retired school counselor who co-chairs the board of an organization called Stop Foodborne Illness, has an in-depth PowerPoint presentation that she shows to journalists and advocacy organizations to underscore how food poisoning is, she says, “not just vomiting and diarrhea.”  It begins with photos of Chris on a ventilator in a pediatric intensive care unit, his blond hair matted and hands tied to the bed so he couldn’t pull a nasogastric tube out of his throat. For five days, “he was on death’s door,” his mother says. He was given Versed and morphine to calm him and keep him from ripping out the tubes; every time he woke, his eyes would widen into a panic as he tore at them. “He was also suffering from acute pancreatitis,” McGonigle-Martin says, “and couldn’t eat for two months.”  Chris was in the hospital at the same time as an 11-year-old girl sickened by the same outbreak; McAfee, McGonigle-Martin recalls, took a small private plane to visit both kids’ families. “He flew down to the hospital and waited outside the pediatric intensive care unit to talk,” McGonigle-Martin says. When she and McAfee met in the hallways, “I hugged him and said, ‘I can’t imagine how worried you are about all this.’” (McAfee says that he made a visit in his Volvo and that Chris was out of the ICU when he arrived.)   “I can support RFK Jr. on all of this stuff. But raw milk is in a different category.” The spirit of collaboration did not last: McGonigle-Martin and the family of the other child both sued Organic Pastures, eventually settling out of court; all parties have declined to discuss the terms. Asked today about whether he believes his products could have sickened the children, McAfee replies, “We don’t know, but our insurance company settled the issue in 2007.” He went on to claim that an outbreak linked to lettuce spread similar pathogens around the same time and that “a pathogen was never found in any of our products” by state investigators. Chris ultimately made a full recovery and is now a healthy young adult. But he and his mother were both traumatized by his hospitalization. Chris’ experience also turned McGonigle-Martin into an activist.  “He is a miracle,” she says. “He should not be in the shape he’s in. That’s always given me the energy to speak out and tell my story so another parent wouldn’t make the same mistake. I support health food. I eat organic. I can support RFK Jr. on all of this stuff. But raw milk is in a different category.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s belief in raw milk runs deep. Not only is he a drinker, but he’s also been a keynote speaker at the annual conference of the Weston A. Price Foundation. Kennedy’s own 2024 VP pick, tech entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan, made a campaign stop at Raw Farm and praised its cleanliness while denouncing the “constant media attack and regulatory scrutiny” the company is under. According to the Guardian, McAfee has said members of Kennedy’s transition team have asked him to apply for a federal “position advising on raw milk policy and standards development.”  Such a job would allow him to advance his near-messianic belief in raw milk’s abilities, at a time when avian flu threatens to contaminate the industry’s products. But McAfee is exceedingly dismissive of bird flu—he calls it a “huge scam” pushed “by pharma to create fear and produce a new vaccine…after Covid closed up.” “Trace the money,” he wrote in an email, in which he also denied bird flu could be a threat to his business or his customers’ health.  “We don’t think avian flu causes things to be unsafe,” he explains. “You may think I’m some kind of crazy person. But show me one person who’s ever gotten sick from raw milk with avian flu.”  “Viruses,” he says, “don’t exist in raw milk. They die off quickly.”  “Fearing viruses is ridiculous,” he says; he holds that only people lacking “strong microbiomes” and good immune systems need worry. Of Covid, for instance, he says: “I got it and it was mild. I’m a raw milk drinker. It didn’t hardly faze me.” “We’re always going to have a new threat. We’re ignoring the blueprints of life, which is raw milk,” he told me. “Inflammation and chronic disease are rampant. The solution is whole-food nutrition.”  McAfee also insists that Raw Farm’s safety standards are top of the line, boasting of his “on-farm pathogen lab,” which can deliver “results in 20 hours so that we don’t have to wait four days.”  “We can find the needle in the haystack,” he says. McAfee is also the founder of a nonprofit, the Raw Milk Institute, which offers certifications and safety training for other farmers. Farmers who want to become RAWMI-certified, he says, have to adhere to the same high standards he boasts of at Raw Farm. But the idea that there’s any way to make raw milk as safe as pasteurized milk is simply not true, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. Under Trump, “you may see…a lack of enforcement, a lack of inspections.” “I appreciate the fact that he’s tried to distinguish his business from less scrupulous raw milk providers,” she says, “and has all these standards that he’s tried to put in place. But the fact is you can have the cleanest cow udders in the world and take all this care with your milking equipment and do this monitoring, but if you’re not pasteurizing your milk, you’re always going to be at risk of these more common foodborne pathogens.” In general, virtually every major public health body—both in the US and in Europe—agrees raw milk contains unavoidable risk. (The European Food Safety Authority, for instance, recommends it be boiled.)  Rasmussen tracks the ways that false ideas about disease, viruses, and “wellness” spread online, and since Kennedy endorsed Trump in late August, she’s seen raw milk become a tenet of the Make America Healthy Again bible. If Kennedy is confirmed to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, “he’s mentioned it by name as something that he’s going to deregulate or make more available to people,” she points out.  RFK and his fellow advocates, Rasmussen says, have extended their philosophies about health and liberty beyond vaccines, looking for more things to hold out as “alternatives” to mainstream concepts of health and wellness, freedom, and safety. “It looks like raw milk is one of those things,” she says.  Bill Marler is a Seattle-based food poisoning attorney who has repeatedly sued Raw Farm, representing McGonigle-Martin and other parents who claimed their children were sickened by his products. “He’s a really interesting cat,” Marler says of McAfee, not without a kind of respect. “He has a bit of the religious fervor of a proselytizer. He woos a lot of people. He’s a very charismatic character. He’s found his niche where the hippies and the preppers converge.”  Under Trump and Kennedy, Marler says, the government could step back and give raw milk merchants like McAfee more latitude to operate. “What you may see is a lack of enforcement, a lack of inspections,” Marler says. “You may not necessarily see it in publications that there’s an increase or decrease in food poisoning cases. They may stop counting.”  Bird flu could offer an early test of this Trump-era regulatory framework. In December, after the virus was found in samples of Raw Farm milk being sold and headed for store shelves, the company agreed to a voluntary recall and was barred from shipping new product under a state quarantine that lasted until January 10. After it was lifted, McAfee sent me an email: “The joy is palpable,” he wrote, with his “consumers driving 3 hours to the farm with ice chests because they could not wait for deliveries to stores in LA.” The cows powering those sales, he claimed, “are producing H5N1 antibodies in their raw milk. Just like nature provides.” Similarly, the first time I spoke with McAfee, when Raw Farm was under quarantine, he insisted no one—not even cats—should be able to contract bird flu from his milk by the time it reached the region’s store shelves, claiming “bioactives” inside it would neutralize the virus. (Rasmussen points out that some of the antiviral compounds raw milk advocates claim as a health benefit are “also present in pasteurized milk” without the risks; either way, studies involving influenza haven’t found meaningful antiviral effects.) At this point, it’s simply not clear whether avian flu can be transmitted to people through raw milk. But the concern from health agencies is substantial—and the deaths of the house cats is another data point adding to it.  When I asked McAfee about the cats’ deaths, he emailed me several photos of Cindy, the Raw Farms barn cat, looking hale. Cindy’s good health, McAfee says, is due in no small part to all the fresh raw milk she drinks—and living proof of the unjustified war the FDA is waging against him and against the life-changing benefits he insists raw milk provides.  “The FDA is lying to consumers, saying that pasteurization does not change milk,” he wrote in an email. “It does, radically. Our consumers know this is a lie and don’t trust the FDA at all.” But the makeup of the FDA could soon change, and the long dispute that McAfee has had with the agency could end. As Kennedy’s confirmation hearing looms, McAfee is pinning his hopes on the man he says is a loyal customer taking charge of the agency that’s targeted Raw Farm and offering relief, vindication, and stable ground to keep building his raw milk empire. It all, he says, hinges on Kennedy. “If RFK doesn’t make this, I don’t see making it,” McAfee said.  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "content": "Silas “Uncle Si” Robertson is on the mend following an accident during a recent hunting trip. The “Duck Dynasty” star sparked concern when he didn’t appear on his podcast, “Duck Call Room.” However, his absence was due to a recent hospitalization. His co-host Justin Martin detailed the incident, revealing that Robertson spent three days in the emergency room after falling off a boat during a hunting trip in Arkansas. Sources tell The Post that cameras were not rolling when Uncle Si fell or during his hospital stint. However, he is already back filming the newly-announced “Duck Dynasty” revival and is “doing fine.”  “Typical Silas Robertson, in a dang hurry to get out of the boat,” Martin explained. “He went to take a long step instead of waiting for us to move the decoys and the shotguns… A BDH, a Big Dang Hurry, and he fell.” He continued, “When he fell, he fell on his oxygen machine — you know how he wears it like a bandolier.” However, Martin shared that Robertson jumped up and insisted he was fine. “I think he didn’t want anybody to see that he fell,” he said. “Except the problem is you’re covered in mud now, so we know that he fell.” Martin said that Robertson continued to claim he was okay, but as the day went on, it appeared that the situation was more serious. He shared that he noticed the TV star was quieter than usual, leading Martin to wonder if Robertson had a concussion. “Duck Dynasty” alum Phillip McMillan also shared that days later, Robertson admitted to him that he was “in a lot of pain,” adding, “I’ve been in pain for three days.” They said that Robertson was experiencing low oxygen levels, which prompted his family to get him medical attention at the ER.  X-rays showed he sustained bruised ribs from his tumble. His low oxygen levels were allegedly attributed to panic attacks, a reaction to the pain from his injury.  Robertson was given medication and has since been discharged to recover at home. This isn’t his first health scare. In Sept. 2022, the “Duck Dynasty” star had surgery on his lungs after developing breathing difficulties that he attributed to smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19 complications.  Robertson appeared on 11 seasons of “Duck Dynasty” and landed a spinoff series, “Going Si-Ral.” Last week, it was revealed that Robertson will return to television in the upcoming “Duck Dynasty: The Revival,” which will follow Willie Robertson, wife Korie Robertson and “their growing family of adult children and grandchildren, the next generation of Robertsons living on the family homestead in Louisiana.” “Going back on A&E feels a little like going back home,” the couple shared in a joint statement. “We’re thankful for all who have followed along as our family has grown and expanded and can’t wait to get cameras rolling again on all our new adventures, or perhaps misadventures.” The revival is expected to premiere in summer 2025. The Post reached out to A&E for comment. Advertisement"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hollywood Life\n\n Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News \n\t\t\t\tJustin Martin and Phillip McMillan revealed the 76-year-old was hospitalized after a hunting accident. Find out if he recovered.\t\t\t \nFind Out\n  Silas Merritt Robertson, a.k.a. Uncle Si from Duck Dynasty, was hospitalized for several days following a hunting accident, Justin Martin and Phillip McMillan revealed in a January 2025 episode of their podcast, “Duck Call Room.” After they broke the news, the internet exploded. Many fans feared that the 76-year-old could have died from the medical emergency. In fact, multiple X users presumed he was dead. So, what exactly happened to Uncle Si, and is he alive? Below, Hollywood Life is breaking down everything that happened to Duck Dynasty‘s Uncle Si. Martin and McMillan revealed on their podcast that Uncle Si “fell trying to get out of the boat,” pointing out that the fall was “steep.” “Typical Silas Robertson, he’s in a dang hurry to get out of the boat and into the Polaris, he fell,” Martin said. “He went to take a long step instead of waiting on us,”w Though Martin said that Robertson “bounced right back up,” he admitted that Uncle Si “didn’t want anybody to see that he fell,” but “the problem is you’re covered in mud now, like we know you fell.” After getting back to the clubhouse to enjoy breakfast, Martin recalled they looked around and “there’s no Si” anywhere, adding that Robertson was “just sitting outside in the cold.”  A post shared by Uncle Si (@sirobertson)  “I immediately thought he had a concussion because it was out of character,” Martin pointed out, before McMillan added, “I get a call from Christine’s caretaker, Elizabeth. She says, ‘Phillip, we’re heading to the ER.'” Robertson was hospitalized because his oxygen level was low, which could have been from a panic attack, the co-hosts pointed out. “I said, ‘What is going on?’ And I figured he would start laughing and talking. [But] no, he said, ‘Man, I’m in a lot of pain,'” McMillan noted. “He said, ‘I fell duck hunting and I think I broke some ribs.’ He always thinks it’s worse than it is.” Fortunately, yes, Robertson is alive and recovering from his injury, Martin and McMillan pointed out. After performing X-rays and blood work, McMillan revealed that “everything came back good” with “no broken ribs [or] bruised ribs.” Multiple X users baselessly speculated that Robertson had died.  A post shared by Uncle Si (@sirobertson)  More than two years before his recent hospitalization, Uncle Si had surgery on his lungs in September 2022. At the time, he had trouble breathing, which Robertson attributed to his smoking habits, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a.k.a COPD) and even complications from COVID-19.

        "content": "Bird Song of the Day  Brown Thrasher, Elkinsville Rd. and Kirk’s Ford Rd., Brown, Indiana, United States. Grab a cup of coffee for nineteen minutes of thrashing! * * * In Case You Might Miss…   * * *  Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * *            Trump Administration “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” [Axios]. “President Trump is surprising — even frustrating — some longtime friends in his second administration’s early days with fewer leaks, a lack of exploitable rivalries, and tighter restrictions on access to him. Why it matters: No modern president has done more — across more areas of American policy, culture and life — than Trump in the past six days. This new operating style and system enabled a strategy of flooding the nation with so many huge moves that it’s hard for critics to attack specific ones.” And: “It’s stunning to veterans of Trump’s first West Wing. But at least in Week 1, the new government has mirrored the discipline of his 2024 campaign operation — another sharp contrast with his previous teams…. There’s a ‘strong silo system’ that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added.” Interestingly: “The biggest change of all, Axios has learned, is that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and other aides have clamped down on the ability of random friends and reporters to call Trump directly. Until now, if you had his phone number and called, Trump would answer and talk to you — and maybe even act on whatever you suggested. Now, Trump wants to focus more on work and has less time for bull sessions so he’s less prone to answer his phone.” • Of course, some might suggest that we want Trump to “work” as little possible. “Confident, organised, still freewheeling: Trump 2.0 has learned from past” [BBC]. “The stacks of leather-bound executive orders piled high on the Resolute Desk illustrate how the Trump 2.0 era is set against a different political landscape from four years ago – one which has produced a more emboldened commander-in-chief…. ‘It’s been much more disciplined, on-point and issue-focused,’ said Lawrence Muir, a former official in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mr Muir, who was tasked with hiring administration personnel as part of the 2016 Trump transition team, told the BBC his work was ‘essentially discarded’ by the incoming White House at the time. ‘They did not have a great idea about what they were supposed to be producing, or how to produce it,’ he said. ‘[Trump’s] doing much better this time in terms of what he’s getting out, getting it out efficiently, and knowing how it has to be enforced down through the agencies.'” * * * “Trump’s agenda is about to hit a make-or-break moment” [Politico]. “House Republicans are heading to President Donald Trump’s Miami-area resort for their annual policy retreat…. The biggest task for the gathering at Trump National Doral: Finalize a budget blueprint plan for the massive, party-line bill they’re planning, touching energy, border security and tax policy. But to do that, Republicans need to decide what will go in that package — with the price tag of Trump’s priorities reaching $10 trillion over 10 years — versus what might be included in a separate, bipartisan government funding bill that will be negotiated with Democrats over the next seven weeks. The fate of a necessary debt ceiling increase is top of mind…. The planned retreat discussions have been tailored to show attending members the possibilities for the way forward and to take their temperatures on potential spending cuts, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the planning. Leaders will have to carefully balance sometimes competing interests from various GOP factions.” And: “Centrists are also relaying their concerns to GOP leaders about some committees’ plans to target pieces of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food aid benefits for more than 40 million low-income Americans…. Those proposals are relatively more palatable for GOP lawmakers in competitive districts than the massive cuts to current benefits some conservatives would prefer. But they’re still politically divisive and could provide Democrats major campaign fodder in blue and purple districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.” • But cutting Medicaid, though easy and fun, won’t get those trillions. It never does. * * * “Trump actions could wreak havoc on South Florida’s sizeable Colombian population” [Miami Herald]. “Florida is home to 473,606 Colombians, according to the U.S. Census data. The state has long been a magnet for new arrivals from the South American country who are seeking a place where there are many Spanish speakers, a warm climate and a ready-made community.” • Interestingly, the story doesn’t sat what percentage of those new arrivals have their papers in order. “Trump wants to tackle inflation. Will these top actions bring prices down?” [WaPo]. The deck: “Here’s six key actions, executive orders and promises, from this past week and how they would affect inflation.” More: “‘The reality is, inflation of the type we have gets embedded into the economy and takes a long time to wring out,’ said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. ‘There aren’t many quick solutions.'” Be that as it may, the six: Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; New tariffs and trade policies [▲]; Expanding oil and gas drilling, other energy overhauls [▼]; Rolling back regulations [▼]; Undoing Biden’s efforts to lower prescription drug prices[?]; Lowering interest rates[▲].” • Triangles for what WaPo thinks could go up, or down. “Trump shocks the system. Will he solve problems voters care about most?” [Dan Balz, WaPo]. “The larger issue for Trump, and what ultimately will determine the political and substantive success of his second term, is whether this flurry of activity signaling a major course change will result in the betterment of the lives of the voters who supported him in November. Getting rid of DEI offices and personnel will cheer his most loyal supporters and hurt a federal workforce in a nation becoming more ethnically diverse. It won’t necessarily help families struggling to pay bills. Deporting millions of undocumented immigrants in fact could raise food prices and further labor shortages…. Shocking the system is one thing. Providing tangible results to people is another.”   2028 “The 12 Democrats who make the most sense for 2028” [WaPo]. Starts out well: “Save for a few months at the tail end of the 2024 campaign, the party hasn’t had an authoritative, dominant leader for a long time.” Really? 2024? Who was that? Anyhow, here are the 12, starting with #12: Tim Walz, Josh Stein, Andy Beshear, Gavin Newsom, Raphael G. Warnock, Wes Moore, Ruben Gallego, John Fetterman, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer, and — at #1! — Josh Shapiro. It’s been a long time since I deployed the “Please kill me now” trope….      Our Famously Free Press “Too Much News, Redux” [Jon Allsop, Columbia Journalism Review]. “I noted in 2020 that the ‘basic rhythms’ of the news business aren’t designed to cope with deluges of huge stories: whatever the day’s news, it must be stretched or shrunk to fill roughly the same number of newspaper column inches or cable news hours; the internet, of course, theoretically offers near-infinite space for news coverage to expand, but many digital formats—from homepages to newsletters—themselves have spatial limits, and that’s before we get into strained newsroom resources and apparently diminished audience buy-in, as Stelter pointed out last week. These constraints make it hard for the news media, as a collective apparatus, to communicate proportion. We have tools for organizing stories by importance—back in 2020, I noted that the New York Times had run thirty-three banner front-page print headlines in less than six months, smashing even its election-year average—but the constant blare of headlines, as I noted, can have a ‘flattening effect, making it harder, over a long period of time, to distinguish actual news from attention hustling.’ The problem of proportionality is recurring now. A story previewing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s potentially radical plans to ‘target vaccines’ should he be confirmed as health and human services secretary appeared about halfway down a major Politico newsletter on Friday; yesterday, the CIA lab-leak story made the front page of the Times, but only in brief form at the very bottom. Needless to say that in the summer of 2020, both these stories would have been earth-shaking.” • Allsop complains of Trump’s tendency to make news, or at least news stories — “flood the zone with sh*t” — but I think there are more stories out there, as one would expect as a function of slow civilizational collapse (newsrooms are smaller too).    Democrats en déshabillé “Playbook: A tough Week One for Democrats” [Politico]. “On Saturday, at their winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, Democrats will make their first consequential decision since their November drubbing: selecting a new chair of the DNC. In the opening days of the new administration, Democrats have struggled to frame Republicans, careening from the critique that Trump has surrounded himself with ‘broligarchs,’ as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) put it, to whether Elon Musk made a Nazi salute. Senate Democrats have zigged and zagged on their Cabinet confirmation votes. Of course, not all nominees are equal. But they are clearly divided over tactics in responding to Trump’s program.” • Maybe — hear me out — the important Democrat problems aren’t at the tactical level?  “In the wilderness: Democrats struggle to navigate the politics of new Trump era” [Guardian]. “‘He’s been in office less than a week, and you’ve already seen a federal court with a judge who was appointed by a Republican president – a president that much of the conservative movement in America upholds – say that he’s operating blatantly unconstitutionally,’ said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the non-profit legal group Democracy Forward. ‘I think what you’re going to see is more sophisticated legal responses this time because civil society, I think, is much more organized and savvy to this playbook.’ Democracy Forward is one of more than 350 organizations that have joined a coalition known as Democracy 2025, which has the explicit aim of ‘disrupting any efforts by the Trump-Vance administration to attack our rights.’ ‘The message that we want to send to all Americans across the country is thbe doing is demanding a president and a Congress that does the same thing,’ Perryman said.” • So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizatioat there are lawyers and advocates who are going to be in court every single day fighting for your rights, and what we need to ns is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole.  “Trump Just Broke the Law. Blatantly. And He Might Get Away With It” [Michael Tomaskey, The New Republic]. On Trump firing the 15 Inspectors General: “Under the original law, presidents had to give Congress 30 days’ notice about their intent to fire an I.G. and just supply some vague reason why. President Barack Obama’s excuse for firing the I.G. of national service programs was simply a lack of confidence in the guy. Then came Trump. As Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith wrote at Lawfare in 2022, ‘More frequently than prior presidents, [Trump] manipulated vacancies and related laws to fire or dismiss disliked inspectors general and replace them, pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), with a more like-minded or pliant official.’ So Congress, through a larger defense bill, amended the I.G. law by replacing the word ‘reasons’ with the phrase ‘substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons.’ In sum, Congress toughened this law because of Trump. And now, Trump has broken the provision that was added in response to his flouting of the original law! That he broke the law is obvious. He didn’t give 30 days’ notice. He didn’t provide any ‘substantive rationale.’ He didn’t provide any reason at all. He just did it. And he told reporters Saturday that it was all fine. ‘It’s a very common thing to do,’ he said. Once he says that, we know that basically every Republican, and Fox News and Sinclair and the rest of the propaganda chamber, are going to say the same thing. Lindsey Graham on Sunday hilariously admitted that ‘technically, yeah,’ Trump broke the law but Graham wasn’t losing any sleep over it.” • It’s a good thing that four solid years of lawfare (eight, if you count RussiaGate) didn’t make people cynical about Democrat accusations of illegality, because this thing looks like it could have legs.   Realignment and Legitimacy “Column: The rise of Silicon Valley, from indifference to lords of the political universe” [Los Angeles Times]. “When the high and mighty of Silicon Valley assumed their privileged perch at the swearing-in of President Trump, it was an ostentatious show of wealth and power unlike any before. ‘You could go back to the Gilded Age and you could have a similar concentration of capital and power. You know, Rockefeller and Carnegie,’ said historian Margaret O’Mara, citing two of the richest men who ever bestrode the earth. ‘But they weren’t on the dais of the inauguration.’…. The explanation for their propinquity lies not in the creation of some whiz-bang, life-changing, paradigm-bending consumer product, or the shining virtues or particularly fertile minds that grace Silicon Valley’s fruited plain. ‘It’s one of the oldest truisms in politics,’ said Larry Gerston, a San José State political science professor emeritus, who’s followed the tech industry from a front-row seat for decades. ‘Money buys access.’ Bezos’ Amazon and Zuckerberg’s Meta were among the tech firms that tithed $1 million each to help pay for Trump’s inauguration. Musk invested more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump. Given his conjoined-twin closeness to the 47th president, it appears money well spent.'”    Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

From December 5, 2024: “[D]ata strongly suggests that the virus, known as H5N1, has spread primarily* through milk. It replicates quickly in the udders of infected cows, which produce milk with sky-high levels of the pathogen. Droplets of milk can splash into dairy workers’ faces, while milk-splattered equipment and vehicles can transport the virus from cow to cow…. In theory, a virus that spreads through milk should be easier to control than one that floats invisibly in the air. But a look inside the modern dairy industry reveals that milk-based transmission is profoundly worrying. ‘Milk is hugely problematic,’ said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University.” • Detail on how humans and robots milk cows. Commentary:  I only know what I read in the papers, so perhaps some kind reader can comment on this solution.

People in traditional communities where everyone naps live longer than people in modernized ones where they don’t. The siesta is lifesaving. Walker even conjectures that our peculiar sleep patterns may explain our evolutionary advance. We sleep less than other primates, but get relatively more REM sleep, and the dreams it brings, than our monkey and ape cousins. It is during REM sleep, Walker insists, that we engage in ’emotional processing.’ The mnemonic collisions during this phase forge new connections among our experiences, and we wake not merely refreshed but revived and enlightened by our re-wrought neural networks.” • Hmm. * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\r\n\r\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Great links today.  Thanks. > Great links today. Thanks. Well, thank you! Love the Hopper painting as well “Rooms for Tourists.” Found this- ‘Edward Hopper’s paintings of buildings are portraits, in which the human presence is implied but not seen. In Rooms for Tourists, Hopper portrays the exterior of a boarding house in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He made study drawings of the building and then traveled there repeatedly at night while he worked on the painting. The contrast between the warm, electrically lit interior and the darkness of night outside captures the sense of transience and impermanence inherent in the boarding house’s impersonal arrivals and departures.’ https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/52638 “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed”\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseeks-janus-pro-ai-model-beats-rivals-image-generation-2025-01-27/ > “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” We need a Sam Altman Downfall parody, for sure.

Moon of Alabama wrote this development up.  The Raspberry Pi’s are now sold out.  Deepseek software is free and will run on this device.\nThis deserves some recognition. Please stop amplifying nonsense. Deepseek’s frontier model R1 is 671 billion parameters. Model parameters are directly correlated with compute requirements and quality of output. 671 billion parameter model won’t run on a powerful desktop computer, let alone a Raspberry Pi. Even with their optimization tricks, it still has to compute 32 billion parameters. What they were running on pi is a tiny model with terrible output quality. All tiny models (and I have played with many) are toys, and their outputs are completely unreliable.  Smaller 7 billion parameter models do run on desktop computers already, including small Llama, Mistral, Gemma etc. models with a 6 core Ryzen CPU running it are an intolerable 20-30 tokens per second. To give you a reference of that speed, the model would output the length of your comment in about 5 seconds.  Tiny models with 1 billion parameters run on Rasberry pi’s, and DeepSeek’s tiny-model is not the first one to do so. There are AI video tools that could do this, put his face on Hitler. Could they capture his uber-PMC mannerisms? We need a new classification to describe half-built, abandoned data centers, now that DeepSeek has moved our tech oligarchs cheese. Busted bunkers? Rebar-wrecks? I am sure Wukchumni will have a nice suggestion. Maybe make nightclubs from the wreckage? This Los Angeles Stock Exchange building opened in 1931 and the company merged into the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange in 1956. It was incorporated as the Pacific Stock Exchange in 1973.It was the largest regional stock exchange west of the Mississippi. In 1986, the exchange moved to another site. By the end of the decade, the Stock Exchange, a nightclub, opened in the renovated building. All-night raves in the site of an abandoned rebar-wreck … I like it! With all that physical security built in (6-foot thick walls, security cameras, fences) it will keep the cops out, too.   Bomb shelters probably made good speakeasies, back in the day. If they can pull it off, panic at the disco shifting nicely to panacea at the datacenter Indoor bull rings? Go all Elizabethan and include Bear Rings too! Here’s a Ryan Grim post explaining the current DeepSeek invasion and a shout out to Lisa Kahn:\n“U.S. tech stocks are plummeting as China looks to be exposing American companies involved in AI as wildly overvalued. It’s a predictable consequence of how the American government has approached Silicon Valley and vice versa. This isn’t the kind of thing we normally cover, but we don’t quite trust the U.S. media to tell this story accurately.” https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/deepseek-openai-lina-khan-sam-altman Very good timeline development and technology explanation.

Democrats doing lawfare is also an admission that the current system services liberal Democrat purposes just fine, Their Democracy, and they don’t have any particular interests in making any changes that might provide material benefits. Kind of mind-bending that we went from the Biggest Threat Ever to Trump is a president to be opposed by gentle lawfare efforts. Wat? Anyone can do lawfare.    Part of the Civil Rights Revolution was conducted through the Courts, and that was lawfare.    Lawfare was one weapons system and demonstrations/marches/Freedom Rides/etc. was another weapons system and political organizing/registering to vote/voting was another weapons system.\nDamage suits against the oil companies are lawfare.    If lawfare is the only weapons system you have, you use that or you use nothing at all.    So the question becomes, who is using lawfare against whom, and in service to what? Democracy 2025. Lambert comments: “So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizations is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole.” But Lambert, they’re FIGHTING for us. Surely that’s all we need to know, isn’t it? Isn’t it? re: “they’re FIGHTING for us”.(tm)  Please send money. / ;) > But Lambert, they’re FIGHTING for us. Surely [bangs head on desk] These lawfare Democrat should count themselves extremely lucky that nobody seems to give a [family blog] about that genocide they’ve all been facilitating.  Last I checked murdering tens of thousands of women and children was frowned upon by the law… FIGHTING to get us ACCESS! Gotta keep their powder dry for the Political DDAY! The democrat list for 2025 looks like they want a president Vance. Also just read a Tweet from team D that Orange Hitler has spent 30% of his presidency playing golf. Giggle. So he has done so much his first week they can’t get a grip on what to be outraged about, yet he spent too much time playing golf. Crazy times we live in. Did they factor in the time spent on that Colombia President mulligan? ;) It really is not a good look at all for AOC, et al. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon.  That was their priority. Meanwhile, and so far, all the attention rounding up these illegals seems to be on the criminals, etc.  I would make a rational assumption that the planes to Colombia are pretty much those kind of immigrants.  In other words, exactly who needs to be sent home.  And by so doing – protecting the kids and families of America who should not be forced to live next to pimps, drug runners and criminals. My patient family today who brought in their grandma were just effusively singing the praises of Donald Trump.  “He understood these bad people need to go home” and “he cares about our safety”. etc. Ummm, AOC – the coffee and flowers routine is not working on these people.  Of course coffee and daily Starbucks hits are much more important issues to your constituency.  It will be really entertaining when it is Mexico’s turn….Oh me oh my, what are we ever going to do without our avocado toast?   Better luck next time.  Not to mention is the entire flower issue is predicated on the fact that the entire industry was moved to Colombia by NAFTA neoliberals, leaving all of those American workers behind to learn how to code and leaving boarded up greenhouses – STILL THERE – saw it this summer – in their wake. The other thought going through my head last night…….There must be a couple hundred very bad people on that plane that the President of Colombia would risk a trade war to keep them out. This is going to be a very interesting four years.   This is going to be a very long four years for the AOC crowd if this absolutely pitiful response is going to be the best they can do. One thing that the “rights people” do that’s offensive to those whom they think they are currying favor with is that they go out of way defending various dubious people who happen to be members of a certain group, as if they are being persecuted because they belong to that group, while ignoring the bit about their being dubious (e.g. criminals etc.)  They feed the preconception (which, perhaps, they themelves hold, that members of that group are predisposed to criminality, say (and, worse, “can’t help themselves,” because of culture or whatever.)    In other words, attempts at playing “culturism” winds up being pretty much a perpetuation of racism (possibly, that, their own racism.)  Having been on the other end often enough (allegedly positive “model minority” stereotypes and variations of thinly disguised “yellow peril” ones), I’ve found this tendency profoundly offensive a bit too often. This makes a deal of sense.  The NGOs claiming to rescue the victims must insist the victims are always and immutably victims. There is no out or up or escape into better lives  for the victims, only the ministrations of the NGOs can make the victims lives better, the NGOs may claim.  The NGOs may do good work at one level but terrible blocking at another level. I am amazed that people, especially intelligent people who should know better, eat up the propaganda stunt of the denied deportation flight. Look at how I’m going to stare down the government of any country on earth: 1. arrange a flight that doesn’t follow normal protocols (shackling deportees), using military planes (do you want other countries to fly their military planes into the US without getting permission first??)\n2. say nasty things when flight gets rejected\n3. arrange a more normal flight the next day\n4. declare victory when it gets accepted Also, if he’s really going to do mass deportations, where is he going to get all the planes? Why isn’t anyone talking about ships yet? (Hint: he’s not really serious about the mass deportations.) They say their target is 1200-1500 people per day. That is at most less that 2.2 million people over Trump’s entire term. My understanding is that 2 million illegal migrants came every year during Biden’s term. So they’d need to increase the rate four-fold to return the number of illegal migrants at the end of Trump’s first term. There were supposedly 12 million illegal migrants in the US at the end of Trump’s first term, and if an additional 8 million arrived, there would be 20 million of them. That would mean each one has a 1/10=10% chance of being deported.  Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; I don’t see why we should expect that to cause inflation, particularly if those who are deported have been convicted of engaging in activities that reduce productivity (crimes such as theft, procuring drugs, making places unsafe, etc). It’s not as if Biden’s term, during which the number of illegal migrants increased by 8 million, is known for reducing inflation. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority.  I guess the one million homeless Americans, the threats to the food supply, not to mention the price of it, and various other things are not important?  If I couldn’t afford coffee, I would just buy tea, as much as I have started with coffee most every morning for forty years.  Really, the arguments from the Democratic Party and its supporters are getting more unserious by the day. very good IM DOC, lets remind all what NAFTA stands for,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement North American Free Trade Agreement  it was sold to us by neo-liberal weasels in the economic professions, politicians, media shills as free trade, because it is free trade for a few. now they say there is no such thing as free trade, after its imploded. under free trade, government no longer has sovereignty and democratic control. government is now subservient to capital, they now are the enforcers of free trade for capital. https://fpif.org/free-trade-regime-oligarchy-action/ “Let’s put this assertion to the test by looking at the concrete example of free trade agreements and their relation to democracy and national sovereignty. “Democracy” typically refers to a system of government in which people decide on the rules of their sovereign nation. In the true spirit of democracy and sovereignty, all spheres of policy — including the environment, trade, finance, intellectual property, and culture — must be subject to a fair political process and self-determination. In the modern, globalized world, the institutions of democracy and sovereignty exist in tension with another powerful institution: the global market and its free trade regimes.” “While a small number of labor unions and NGOs appear to have some involvement in the process, critics note that many relevant actors have been shut out. As renowned economists Joseph Stiglitz and Dean Baker contend, it is mostly the executive branch and some privileged big corporations that are involved in the process, and are therefore able to shape the treaty to fit their narrow interests.” Pretty sure we’ll have winged piglet passenger service between Davenport and Muscatine before any of those 12 losers get elected President.

People who nap in my culture are considers sick or strange.  But our nights in the winter are so long that we sleep longer at night in the winter and less in the summer. Maybe it is not so much the the siesta is good for all of us, but good for those living in lower latitudes.

The idea of a straight through eight hour sleep is relatively new apparently. Time was when it was custom to go to sleep for a coupla hours, get up for a while – and maybe even go for a walk – and then go to sleep for several hours more. It was our move into an industrial society that broke this sleep pattern- https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/sleeping-through-the-night-is-a-relatively-new-invention.html Time was, not even so very long ago, relatively speaking, when hominins had to get up to tend the fire. I’m sure that King David had others to tend the fire for him. But he still got up at midnight, as Psalm 119:62 shows. If Politico is quoting Amy Klobuchar, my money’s on Ken Martin. In so very many ways he’s the worst possible choice and therefore irrestistable to the double-downers in the DNC.  Same link also quotes Slotkin (MI) trash talking Tulsi Gabbard with one-sided anecdotes and a completely unattributed allegation that Gabbard is not very intelligent, leading me to think that CIA embeds aren’t as smart as we’ve been led to believe.

Good data as usual. New Patrick Lawrence takes a glass half full look at the Trump liftoff and even ventures some explanations. Many of the big-name philosophers of the past 100 years — Husserl, Heidegger, Lévinas, et al. — shared a pronounced preoccupation beginning in the 1920s. I relate this (and the scholars may correct me) to the wreckage of the First World War they found all around them. These were the explorers and developers of the discipline called phenomenology. Who are we? What has become of us, we who dwell in mass, mechanized societies? What is the nature of human relationships? These were among the questions.  Emmanuel Lévinas, a Lithuanian Jew who lived in France (1906–1995) and wrote in French, elevated these matters to an enduring discourse concerning the Self and the Other. Indifference to others, he argued — and how radically must I simplify — lay at the root of the 20th century’s ills and evils. The cult of the individual, he posited (among a lot of other things) must be transcended in favor of relationships with all the Others among us. We realize who we are only by way of these relationships; they are primary. “The Self is possible only through the recognition of the Other,” he wrote, a noted line. So, to continue my simplification: We are social beings first; our individuality derives from our sociality. Lévinas published Totality and Infinity, the book wherein he stated his case most fully and famously, in 1961.  […] Americans are not well-advantaged in these matters, to put the point mildly. We long ago turned our insistence in our individuality into the “ism” of individualism, an ideology that, however far it has taken America in the past, now proves a ball and chain at our ankles. Equally, America has had such power since the 1945 victories that its policy cliques long ago lost interest in the perspectives of others—how the world looks to them, their aspirations, their histories, all the rest. This is why, with admirable but few exceptions, America produces such poor diplomats. It has had no need of them. And the policy cliques in Washington have not yet registered that we have in consequence already begun to fail.   https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/27/patrick-lawrence-trumps-failures-americas-failures/ He’s saying the American cult of individualism also accounts for Trump’s pronouncements about the countries he wants to take over or the map points to be renamed. It’s a bit of megalomania to be sure but also the provincialism of someone who doesn’t worry much about how others might see these ideas. And for that reason he’s saying it’s very unlikely that most of them will come to pass including, one hopes, his recent statements about the Middle East. By contrast the Bidenistas’ fantasies were serious as a heart attack. One might well claim that in that instance the America above all others view morphed into sociopathy. Thanks for your comment.\nOne argument I’ve read about T touting a north-south US empire vs an east-west empire is that the neocon dream of an east-west empire has hit a stopping point.  Whereas, in comparison,  a north-south empire can still be achieved in some fashion, and would also undercut the neocon east-west  dreams, if one wanted to undercut the neocon dreams.\nNot a bad argument, imo.

How many of this bottom 75% would be ready to form or join a party called the New Deal America Party?   ( That would take millions of person-hours at teach-ins all over the country to explain to Americans below a certain age what the “New Deal” even was.   Only then could people decide about joining such a thing or not.    I think it would be worth doing, though.    Maybe it could be taught about in that nationwide network of Reading Rooms which no successor to OWS has yet been able to organize and fund itself to the point of being able to create).    America needs a better Two Party System.    A better Two Parties for a better Two Party System.   A Lower Class Majority Party and a Make America New Deal Party, and they could spend a couple of decades in political cage-match fighting and Darwin could decide which is the better Party. The New Deal teach-ins should emphasize the Second Bill of Rights proposed by FDR. They are never mentioned in the MSM:\n– The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the Nation;\n– The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;\n– The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;\n– The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;\n– The right of every family to a decent home;\n– The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;\n– The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;\n– The right to a good education. https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/franklin-roosevelt-second-bill-of-rights-1944 Here is a picture titled : The UC Davis pepper spray incident that the university paid over $100,000 to ‘erase from the internet’. ”        And here it is, back on the internet.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1ibcewz/the_uc_davis_pepper_spray_incident_that_the/ Spirit of Saint Luigi.

Re: Trump Just Broke the Law From time to time, I end up in discussions on Facebook and I just so happened to come across a discussion regarding this. What Tomasky curiously omits in his piece is that incoming Administrations aren’t affected by the rule stating that you need 30 days of notice to remove an Inspector General. I really hope this isn’t “we’re out of strategies, just do lawfare all over again!” like the first term was. If so, we are in for a long four years. > is. What Tomasky curiously omits in his piece is that incoming Administrations aren’t affected by the rule Good argument. Got a link? The best argument I can find is here – looks like if Democrats are determined, this can go up to the SC: Lawfare Media Not sure what punishment would be in mind if it’s acknowledged that he didn’t go about it the right way (providing 30 days of notice). Alastair Crooke also has a Substack and here’s an interesting discussion with Napolitano about Netanyahoo’s secret intention to restart the genocide and the changing mood of the Israeli public which opposes this. https://conflictsforum.substack.com/p/are-trump-and-netanyahu-on-a-collision Perhaps Trump knows this and his remarks about resettlement were aimed more at Bibi and to forestall.

ATW Livestream Tonight at 8 PM ET/7 PM CT https://www.racket.news/p/atw-livestream-tonight-at-8-pm-et7-1a5 I’ve been watching Tucker Carlson’s lengthy interview with Matt. Good to see Matt in that platform, though sad to see him pushing the idea that masks were unnecessary and their use was instituted as a way of “inducing social conformity”. He seems to be a big Battacharya fan.  Matt did say that inducing social conformity might well have been a motive and, as I understood it, after the fact. I do not recall him saying masks were per se unnecessary. Yes, sad indeed, much as I enjoy Matt’s commentary on many things. He falls into a special category of writers who are usually so spot on, that when they go off into the deep end it is so absurdly wacky and obvious that I’m prepared to cut him more slack that I would for someone of lesser talents. And yet,  do we throw out the baby with the bath water?  Or do we do our own research (horrors!) and come to our own conclusions?  Taking Taibbi and many others into account? The US’s ye olde health authorities having fallen into disrepute, I’ll read widely and come to my own conclusions. Gasp! From How the Messy Process of Milking Cows Can Spread Bird Flu It takes seven hours for the farm to milk all 1,050 cows. Then, the workers spend an hour cleaning, which includes washing out the milking equipment with detergent and hot water. After that, the next eight-hour shift begins, and all the cows are milked again. It’s hard to believe this doesn’t milk the cows to death. Like a war, this runs 24/7. My family’s dairy farm used to milk the cows twice per day, about 10-11 hours apart, so the schedule from the link isn’t that drastic.  Also, dairy cows are “dried off” (not milked at all) for several weeks per year. I’m sure though that your average cow in an industrial herd has a shorter lifespan than one on a small farm that sends most of her day out in the field. That sounds right and on an industrial milk factory as described it would take hours to clean the equipment. If the cows are milked in the same order the milkings would be 10 to 11, maybe 12 hours apart. re: Gallery Wonderful and hilarious Chas Addams cartoon  to think most readers identified with and got a laugh from the Addams Family cartoons.\nCould it be that  we are all more alike than we think. / ;) Great juxtaposition with the Hopper painting, and very apt, imo.

Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line and the coal mine.

I came to the conclusion that Japan is governed by customs, unlike the US which is governed by laws. Yet, if we denigrate both norms and lawsuits, what recourse remains? Heraclitus (fragment 249): “The people must fight on behalf of the law as though for the city wall.” Abraham Lincoln (in “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.”): “As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor…. Let reverence for the laws…become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.” Law is the ultimate propaganda. I think not in the US.  Else why would Davos fellow the American John Kerry claim the US Constitution’s !st Amendment regarding freedom of speech a difficultly and an impediment for “their right to rule”?  Where said “their right” is an entirely undemocratic and shadowy body? Japan has extremely well-shared and well-enforced norms, something absent in the US. So less friction. Hence the recourse in the US to lawsuits (or as some would have it, to lawfare). Property, liberty, and wardship compose authority, first in the solitary individual, then in the family, and finally in the state. (At the state level, wardship consists of all laws, magistracies, judiciary, arms, fortifications, wars, and treaties.) Civil authority, comprised of all three, is political sovereignty, but from what shall this authority derive its justification?  Authority is related to certitude as reason is related to truth. Truth is the object of divine reason–Only god knows the Truth; certitude is all that belongs to man. This certitude depends not on reason but on authority–the authority of our senses or of our informants or of those who have enacted the laws which we receive as determinant or certain. Certitude is a partial knowledge. Certitude is subjective. Certitude is empirical, dependent on experience or tradition, and not on reason.  Hence, progress in history and politics consists in the gradual assimilation of authority to reason. In theory, anyway. The true ‘Red Flag’ in that Resume Now list is the fact that 3 in 10 report having taken out debt to pay living expenses. The more immiserated people become, the more desperate they become, the more angry they become. We are thus seeing first-hand the creation of a revolutionary mass.\nAs people become increasingly “homeless,” Power truly will be out in the street waiting to be picked up.\nWhat the American Democrat Party needs now is an American Lenin to force them into action. Re: “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” “It’s a total black box,” a lobbyist close to the administration told Axios. “Nothing is leaking except what they want.” There’s a “strong silo system” that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added. So… “forum-shopping and end-running administration officials” means either the way things worked in the Trump 1.0 admin, or else it means this has just been the standard operating procedure for DC lobbyists under any recent admin (given time, tho, I’m sure the lobbyists will figure it out). On this subject, if anybody can suggest a good article or book on how lobbyists and lobbying work in DC, I’d be grateful to hear. Is this “news story” real?   Or is it satire?

        "content": "\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2025 07:01 ET\n\n\n | Source:\r\n            \nInvivyd\n\n\n\n\n\nInvivyd\n WALTHAM, Mass., Jan.  27, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Invivyd, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVVD), a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, today announced the submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of an updated immunobridging analysis of pemivibart as ongoing support of a potential amendment to the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for pemivibart, a half-life extended investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb), to include the treatment of mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in certain immunocompromised patients for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options are not accessible or clinically appropriate. PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) received an EUA from the FDA in March 2024 for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of COVID-19 in certain adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe immune compromise. This updated treatment immunobridging analysis, incorporating dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant XEC neutralization data, is similar to the approach and data that supported the PEMGARDA PrEP EUA. The updated analysis is in line with the prior, positive treatment immunobridging analyses of pemivibart versus its parent molecule, adintrevimab, and other comparator mAbs based on prior virus variants, previously submitted to the FDA in mid-2024 and late-2024 in support of the company’s EUA amendment request for COVID-19 treatment. The comparison between pemivibart and adintrevimab illustrates serum virus neutralizing antibody (sVNA) titers, the clinical measure of antiviral activity, conferred by pemivibart substantially exceed those of adintrevimab for the first four days post dosing, after which titers fall modestly below. As a long-acting mAb, pemivibart would be expected to exert meaningful antiviral activity for many months following a single dose. In the STAMP clinical trial, adintrevimab conferred the majority of its maximum antiviral effect by Day 5 and demonstrated a viral load reduction generally in line with PAXLOVID®1. Because pemivibart is dosed intravenously, higher serum drug concentration and corresponding antiviral activity are delivered immediately, compared to the slower distribution of intramuscularly administered adintrevimab. Pemivibart’s pharmacodynamic profile therefore may have some benefit in modifying viral infection and associated clinical outcomes as compared to adintrevimab. Prior randomized control trials of COVID-19 mAbs have underscored the benefit of deploying maximum antiviral activity as early as possible in the treatment of active infection in avoiding hospitalization and adverse morbid/mortal outcomes2. If an EUA amendment for COVID-19 treatment is granted, Invivyd intends to assess the virologic profile of pemivibart in a clinical study designed in collaboration with the FDA. The standing treatment EUA request supporting pemivibart for the treatment of COVID-19 in certain immunocompromised patients for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options, such as PAXLOVID® (nirmatrelvir) therapy, are not accessible or clinically appropriate, relies on the safety profile and sVNA titers of PEMGARDA demonstrated in the CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial. Following the four cases of anaphylaxis seen in the CANOPY clinical trial, no reports of anaphylaxis have been identified to date during post-authorization use of PEMGARDA across potentially thousands of PEMGARDA doses administered in clinical practice. “Current therapies for COVID-19 have significant limitations, for example the drug-drug interaction complications imposed by nirmatrelvir create clinical circumstances in which standard of care may not be possible or appropriate for patients in need.  Patients – particularly the millions of Americans who are immunocompromised – desperately need more and better therapeutic options because COVID-19 is not going away.  Monoclonal antibodies have been highly attractive therapeutic options in the past and the community would welcome the return of a therapeutic mAb,” said Amesh Adalja, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FACEP, Senior Scholar, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The EUA process does not rely on a statutory timeline such as the timelines embedded into the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)-based regulatory actions such as New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) approval processes. Invivyd initially submitted a package to the FDA in support of a COVID-19 treatment EUA amendment request in July 2024, and since has provided consistent, timely updates to the FDA as SARS-CoV-2 virus variation has presented and as Invivyd has generated data in its ongoing industrial virology effort. Of note, given robust and consistent generation of sVNA titers, the direct expression of antibody antiviral activity, and comparability across multiple antibodies, Invivyd believes that the performance of Invivyd antibodies based on sVNA titers represents a well-supported surrogate endpoint and should be considered for approval beyond EUA to enable pemivibart to remain a long-term option for vulnerable, immunocompromised persons. About PEMGARDA PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart) is a half-life extended investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb). PEMGARDA was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd’s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and provided evidence of clinical efficacy in global Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. PEMGARDA has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, KP.3.1.1 and XEC. PEMGARDA targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells.  PEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection (4500 mg), for intravenous use is an investigational mAb that has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA under an EUA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2. PEMGARDA is not authorized for use for treatment of COVID-19 or post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations, should receive COVID-19 vaccination. In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Anaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA and the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers includes a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The most common adverse events (all grades, incidence ≥2%) observed in participants who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise treated with PEMGARDA included systemic and local infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, influenza-like illness, fatigue, headache, and nausea. For additional information, please see the PEMGARDA full product Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, including important safety information and boxed warning. To support the EUA for PEMGARDA, an immunobridging approach was used to determine if PEMGARDA may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Immunobridging is based on the serum virus neutralizing titer-efficacy relationships identified with other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. This includes adintrevimab, the parent mAb of pemivibart, and other mAbs that were previously authorized for EUA. There are limitations of the data supporting the benefits of PEMGARDA. Evidence of clinical efficacy for other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 was based on different populations and SARS-CoV-2 variants that are no longer circulating. Further, the variability associated with cell-based EC50 value determinations, along with limitations related to pharmacokinetic data and efficacy estimates for the mAbs in prior clinical trials, impact the ability to precisely estimate protective titer ranges. Additionally, certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA, and PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS-CoV-2 viral variants. The emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90%, based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies.

Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Market Insights Global and Consulting Pvt. Ltd.\n NEWARK, Del, Jan.  27, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global hospital consumables sales are projected to reach USD 578.0 billion by 2035, from an estimated USD 421.8 billion in 2025. Between 2025 and 2035, sales are expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2%. approximately 2024, medical supplies brought approximately USD 408.8 billion in revenue.Market Overview: The market for hospital consumables is expanding rapidly worldwide due to factors such rising healthcare costs, more hospital admissions, and improvements in medical technology. Syringes, catheters, wound care supplies, gloves, gowns, surgical drapes, and bandages are just a few of the many items that are considered hospital consumables and are necessary for both infection control and patient care. The need for hospital supplies is anticipated to rise sharply in the next years due to the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses and surgical operations across the globe. Businesses are being pushed to create novel treatments in response to the increasing need for efficient management of both acute and chronic wound care. Research on wound healing is being fueled by the growing unmet need for innovative treatments in poor countries. The approval of innovative gadgets and increased R&D expenditures are driving market expansion. Two major causes of this growth are the rising incidence of chronic illnesses and the increase in surgical operations performed worldwide. The market is separated into two segments based on usage: single-use and reusable consumables.

PT’s authors consider how a once iron-clad construct is now up for grabs—and what it means for young people’s mental health today.\n        Verified by Psychology Today \n                                    Posted January 26, 2025\n\n|\n\n\nReviewed by Jessica Schrader\n\n\n Does a smile still hold its magic if hidden behind a mask? For nearly two years, we rarely saw the faces of others. Neurologist Debashish Mridha suggests, “A smile has a magical power; it makes everyone smile back.” But what if no one can see it? In a world of face masks, have we muted the power of a smile, a fundamental human expression? Smiling is touted as a natural stress reliever, aiding heart health, reducing blood pressure, and boosting the immune system by lowering cortisol levels. Whether genuine or forced, smiling stimulates the brain to release endorphins, relieving pain and stress, and serotonin elevates mood. The origins of this phenomenon date back millions of years, as primatologist Signe Preuschoft explains. Smiling likely evolved from a “fear grin” displayed by primates to show submission or harmlessness. Over time, this gesture transformed into a powerful tool for social bonding and emotional expression. Even newborns smile, though early grins are often reflexive. Between 6 and 8 weeks, infants develop a “social smile,” intentionally directed at caregivers. Babies are naturally attuned to female voices and faces, and their smiles often prompt a dopamine release in their parents, elevating mood and strengthening bonds. Smiling is not just an emotional gesture but a biological one, activating the same brain regions in infants and adults that respond to happiness. While smiling often conveys joy, it can also mask pain. “Smiling depression” refers to those who appear cheerful while battling inner turmoil. This major depressive disorder, marked by atypical symptoms, often goes unnoticed. Those affected may be high-achieving, outwardly successful individuals who suppress their struggles. This hidden suffering underscores that a smile does not always reflect inner happiness. Can smiling be overemphasized? Some applications, like China’s facial payment technology, use smiles to link identities with digital systems. In a 1972 study, a severely depressed patient was paid to smile as a behavioral intervention. The results showed no need for further hospitalization, suggesting the potential therapeutic value of smiling. Yet, this finding remained obscure, overshadowed by the rise of pharmacological treatments like Prozac years later. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced widespread mask usage, profoundly impacting social interactions. Masks obscure facial expressions, limiting our ability to communicate and connect. Studies suggest that smiling changes our perception of the world and our responses to others, reinforcing the importance of visible expressions. While potentially slowing virus transmission, masking has also been an unintentional experiment in suppressing one of humanity’s most basic social tools. The impact on children has been particularly significant. Masks hinder their ability to learn social cues, develop empathy, and build emotional resilience. While health concerns are paramount, the long-term consequences on mental health and development must also be considered. Mother Theresa famously said, “Peace begins with a smile.\" Can we foster greater understanding and connection by removing our masks and allowing our smiles to shine? Smiles remain one of the most potent tools for connection and well-being. Whether visible or not, they enrich our lives, improve our health, and foster human connection. So, smile—and let the world smile with you. But make sure they can see it.

        "content": "Sarcopenia is a musculoskeletal condition characterized by the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. Although less commonly seen in some infants and children, regular muscle loss typically begins in a person’s 30s or 40s (though sometimes later) as skeletal muscle mass gradually shrinks (atrophy). By their 70s, people may retain only around half the muscle mass they had in their 20s. As we age, the body undergoes motor unit remodeling, where the nerve supply to muscles shifts via denervation and reinnervation. Remodeled motor units may be less efficient, resulting in slower movement and muscle weakness. A hand test and chair test may be performed to test muscle strength. The handgrip test assesses overall muscle strength, as handgrip strength correlates with strength in other muscles. The recommended cutoff for handgrip strength is <27 kilograms for males and <16 kilograms for females."

As a result, many young people can no longer read or write in cursive. But if you can—or are willing to learn—a wealth of historical documents await you in the U.S. National Archives. The federal organization’s Citizen Archivist program is recruiting volunteers to help transcribe thousands of documents in its collection. Records in need of review are categorized into ‘missions,’ like paperwork relating to women in the First World War or submarine patrol reports during the Second World War…. The National Archives also needs people to tag photographs and other materials to help identify people, events, or places. By improving searchability, the archives become more accessible to historians, genealogists, students, and the public. It’s easy to get started: just register and select a document to begin transcribing. There’s no application, and you can contribute as much or as little as you’d like.

And: “He repeatedly said he wants Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley to lead Helene recovery efforts and pledged additional federal assistance to North Carolina. The president also repeated false claims about FEMA’s work in North Carolina.” Which were: “Trump repeated false claims of FEMA giving support to migrants instead of North Carolina residents. FEMA does distribute funding to some migrant service programs, but those programs are funded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not FEMA’s disaster fund.”  “Trump’s two asks from California: voter ID laws and water flow” [Reuters]. “U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he wanted to secure two things from a visit to California later in the day: voter identification laws and changes to water policy in the wake of massive wildfires. ‘I just want voter ID to start, and I want the water to be released, and they’re going to get a lot of help from the U.S.,’ Trump said during a visit to North Carolina.” • Well, that’s why we have a Federal system, no? “News Analysis: Stakes are high for Newsom and California when Trump visits L.A. wildfires” [Los Angeles Times]. ” California Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Trump shared a surprisingly symbiotic relationship during the Republican’s first term in the White House, with their public sparring and ability to work together in times of crisis elevating both politicians. Whether the two men can overcome an ugly 2024 election cycle and resume a respectful rapport for the benefit of Californians should become clearer when Trump surveys wildfire damage in Los Angeles County….” Those two demands don’t seem “symbiotic” to me. More: “The Democratic governor could end the day with a presidential example of acting like a level-headed leader capable of putting politics — and personal feelings — aside to help his state. Or, Newsom could walk away more vulnerable to criticism that his political gamesmanship and thirst for the national spotlight compromised his ability to deliver for Californians.” • I think Trump senses weakness. We’ll see. Energy in the executive: “Trump moves to revoke clearances of ex-intel officials who signed letter on Hunter Biden laptop” [PBS]. “President Donald Trump says his administration will move to revoke the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a ‘Russian information operation.’ The action is an early indication of the president’s determination to exact retribution on perceived adversaries and is the latest point of tension between Trump and an intelligence community of which he has been openly disdainful.” Implementation: “The president has a lot of authority when it comes to security clearances. The problem the White House will run into is, if they depart from their existing procedures, they could set up a judicial appeal for these 51 people — and it will probably be a class-action suit since they’re all in alike or similar circumstances,” said Dan Meyer, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the security clearance and background check process.”  “Now the truth comes out: Reporters admit Politico snuffed out Hunter Biden laptop story to protect Joe in 2020” [New York Post]. “‘Politico did that terrible, ill-fated headline: 51 intelligence agents, or former intelligence agents, say that the Hunter Biden laptop was disinformation,’ recalled [reporter Neil] Caputo. ‘Turns out that story was closer to disinformation, because the Hunter Biden laptop appeared to be true.'” And: “Caputo told his editor the outlet needed to ‘write about the Hunter Biden laptop’ but was instructed, per orders from ‘on high’ at Politico, not to: ‘Don’t write about the laptop. Don’t talk about the laptop. Don’t tweet about the laptop,’ he was told. So ‘the only thing Politico wound up writing was that piece that called it disinformation.'” More: “The 51 Spies Who Lied — ex-intel officials who signed an open letter that trashed The Post’s laptop scoop as a ‘Russian information operation’ — gave the media cover.” More likely they “briefed’ the editors and publishers. And: “If these intel veterans weren’t sure about Russia’s involvement, and weren’t trying to mislead the public, they could’ve checked with their sources at the FBI, which had already verified the laptop’s authenticity. Or just kept their mouths shut. Brennan & Co. knew exactly what they were doing.” • To the extent that the FBI can “verify” anything…  “Trump’s First Shot in His War on the ‘Deep State'” [The Atlantic]. “In response, the 51 former officials signed a letter asserting that “the arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden’s son Hunter … has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” Mind you, the signatories offered no evidence of a hidden Russian hand in all of this. They supplied no digital trails leading to Russian spies, no confidential sources claiming a connection. And they were up-front about this: ‘We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails … are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement—just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.’ That’s it. They were suspicious. Maybe with good reason. At the time, current officials, with access to classified information, believed that Russian intelligence operatives were trying to feed misinformation about the Bidens to Giuliani, as my colleagues at The Washington Post and I reported at the time. The signatories argued that, based on their long experience doing battle with Russia in the arena of international espionage, people should take their suspicions seriously. If this all sounds like what op-ed writers or self-professed experts on social media or talking heads on TV routinely do, that’s because it is. Indeed, several of the signatories were regular “Never Trump” commentators on cable talk shows, political podcasts, and Twitter.” • IOW, it’s free speech. * * * “Exclusive — CIA Director Ratcliffe: ‘Day-One Thing’ to Get to Bottom of Chinese ‘Origins of COVID,’ Wuhan Lab Leak” (interview) [John Ratcliffe, Breitbart]. I tend not to cite to Breitbart, but here we are: “[RATCLIFFE:] You have people who have been at the different intelligence agencies for so long and focused on the Russia threat — and, as you said, legitimately because [Vladimir] Putin is a bad guy and a regime with a huge nuclear stockpile that we need to talk about — but yeah, the Intelligence Community has been slow to adjust to the fact that China is the primary geopolitical threat we face,” Ratcliffe said. “It’s the second largest economy, and they compete with us across the board on a peer-to-peer basis in a way that Russia can’t, and I think there are reasons for that that are unfortunately — there’s a financial aspect to that. From Washington, DC, to Wall Street to Silicon Valley to Hollywood, there has been a desire to keep China from being labeled a bad guy because a lot of people make a lot of money from China and in China, and China has a lot of influence in all of those places. But our intelligence is clear —I saw that as DNI and now it’s inescapable for people to not see — on how sinister and nefarious the People’s Republic of China and its various arms of the Chinese Communist Party have been. So, we’ve been slow to adjust the focus, and it’s one of the things that the president needs and wants from us.” * * * “Senate advances Pete Hegseth as Trump’s defense secretary, despite allegations” [Associated Press]. “Rarely has a Cabinet choice encountered such swirling allegations of wrongdoing. The outcome provides a measure of Trump’s power and a test for the Senate as it considers the president’s other outsider Cabinet picks, including Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., for Health and Human Services, Kash Patel at the FBI and Tulsi Gabbard for Director of the Office of National Intelligence. Republican senators, and some Democrats, appear ready to give the president his team. Only Matt Gaetz, the former congressman who was Trump’s initial choice for attorney general, was met with enough resistance that his nomination was withdrawn.” • Well, Gaetz was trying to interfere with Congressional stock trading. So no wonder. Now to the Senate floor– “‘Mitch McConnell Is In’: Fox News Reports On Ex-Host Pete Hegseth Clearing Key Vote Ahead of Likely Confirmation” [Mediaite]. “So that’s the two senators [Murkowski, Collins] that are out. Mitch McConnell is in as is all as are all the other senators in the conference. Roger Wicker, the Armed Services Committee chairman, had told me right before this vote I’d asked him, do you think you still have the 50? That was when Lisa Murkowski came out as she was a no and he said yes. So they walked into the room here feeling confident. They had whipped the votes for quite some time. And they knew that they had these votes and they would not need JD Vance to come in.” * * * “RFK Jr. applauds Trump’s order to declassify RFK, JFK assassination files” [The Hill]. “‘I think it’s a great move because they need to have more transparency in our government and he’s keeping his promise to have the government tell the truth to the American people about everything,’ Kennedy, President Trump’s nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, told reporters. Kennedy has claimed that the CIA was involved in his uncle’s death. ‘There is overwhelming evidence that the CIA was involved in his murder,’ Kennedy said in a 2023 interview with John Catsimatidis on New York City radio station WABC 770. ‘I think it’s beyond a reasonable doubt at this point.’ RFK Jr. said his uncle was targeted due to his refusal to commit U.S. forces to Vietnam.” • No doubt there will be redactions galore and key documents will have gone mysteriously missing. Nevertheless, such an enormous mass of material ought to be enough to make such judgments as historians make, if not the courts. “RFK Jr.’s allies have a plan to upend childhood vaccination” [Politico]. “‘The people [RFK] really trusts are people that obviously are trying to execute a plan to totally take away vaccines,’ said one of the people with knowledge of the discussions. ‘The risk of overreach, I don’t think is zero.'” And: “‘They’re deadly serious,’ said another person with knowledge of the deliberations. ‘He’s going to move on vaccines and I think he feels he has a mandate.'” • As I’ve said, I don’t think it’s possible to have discussion on vax policy, because RFK’s anti-vaxers are coming for MMR. With measles cases already going up. * * * “Project 2025 parallels in Trump’s executive order avalanche” [Axios]. “A review of Trump’s early executive orders shows clear parallels with Project 2025 on key proposals, such as dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; loosening environmental regulations; and ending certain international agreements. Trump also took steps Project 2025 did not explicitly mention, like declaring an energy emergency and attempting to end birthright citizenship. There are scores of recommendations in the Heritage Foundation plan, like outlawing pornography, that Trump hasn’t touched so far.” • The question for me is whether Heritage is driving the Trump Administration, or whether its proposals were already “in the air” in conservative circles, and so one would expect to see them in Trump executive orders whether Project 2025 existed or not. My sense is the latter (“in the air”). I would be persuaded of the former by extensive verbal parallels, on the order of plagiarism, and overlap in communication by topic (i.e., it’s not enough to say this reactionary dude wrote this screed on Topic A for Heritage, and then got a job with Trump; actual influence on Topic A in executive orders should be shown). Moar reporting, please!  DOGE “Warren sends Musk 30 ideas for DOGE to cut government spending” [The Hill]. “Warren’s Thursday letter to Musk, President Trump’s close ally and the commission’s chair, recommended that he consider numerous progressive policy proposals, including allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, renegotiating Department of Defense (DOD) contracts and curbing tax loopholes for large corporations and the highest earners. ‘With regard to policy, I am disturbed by the dangerous proposals you have discussed and released to date: proposals from you and your allies to cut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, veterans’ benefits, and other programs that tens of millions of Americans count on and rely on are unrealistic and cruel,’ Warren wrote in a 21-page letter. ‘It would be outrageous to cut these programs in the name of government thriftiness while handing out trillions of dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations,’ she added, but she also said the notion that the ‘federal government spends trillions of dollars on wasteful spending is correct. And if you are serious about working together in good faith to cut government spending — in a way that does not harm the middle class — I have proposals for your consideration.’ Warren’s prime proposal when it comes to slashing spending is renegotiating DOD contracts, arguing contractors often price-gouge the department.” • “Liberal Democrat writes fascist a strongly worded letter, film at 11:00.” 2028 “Kamala Harris provides a big signal about her next move” [Politico]. “Kamala Harris hasn’t made any public decisions about what her political future is going to be — but she has already created the organization that will help fuel it. The former vice president established an LLC called Pioneer49 last month in her home state of California, according to her presidential campaign’s final financial disclosure that was filed last week and confirmed by a person familiar with the organization’s plans. The disclosure form described the organization as an ‘entity to assist the former vice president’ and is likely to help fuel Harris’ next political move. There are essentially three options for Harris: run for governor of California in 2026, run for president again in 2028 or decline to run for office and be a leader of the party from the sidelines.” I suppose this entity is funding this timeline clutter:  BREAKING: Kamala Harris is out and about killing it, interacting with normal people in a way that Donald Trump could never.

Manufacturing: “The ‘DEI Theory’ of Boeing’s Undoing” [Maureen Tkacik, The American Prospect]. “Like so many superficially inane right-wing ideas, the DEI theory of the collapse of American aviation contained a kernel of accuracy. Over the past quarter-century, Boeing had devolved from a deeply meritocratic organization into an explicitly anti-meritocratic organization. Engineers and quality officials are repeatedly chastised by their superiors for having too much “knowledge.” I recently interviewed a former quality manager who told me she was mocked and ridiculed for having graduated from aviation school. She said her bosses at Boeing in Charleston, South Carolina, made rude and racist comments about her Black inspectors even as they explicitly encouraged her to hire minorities over white men with aviation experience. That’s because Boeing views its employees as fundamentally disposable and has been for decades now at war with employees who know enough about planes to resist their constant and unrelenting orders to move faster and cut corners.” And of course: “Everyone who knows anything about Boeing understands that the “root cause” of its institutional decline was its 1996-1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, a failed plane maker with a toxic, diabolical culture and a C-suite with an illustrious track record of fomenting distrust, plotting coups, insinuating itself into power vacuums, and bankrupting airplane manufacturers.” • Tkacik is always worth a read.

But studies have uncovered a different culprit: A 2021 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City attributed 50 percent of pandemic-era price increases to profiteering. And in 2024, the Federal Trade Commission concluded that companies had ‘accelerated and distorted’ supply chain problems to reap a windfall during the crisis.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\r\n\r\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I highly recommend the National Archives transcription project. It’s great! I transcribed my 5th GGF’s Revolutionary War pension records, and pension records for a few other Rev War veterans in my cemetery. It’s a good brain exercise, and does a wonderful service. The transcription program they have is very easy to use. I’m pretty dumb at computer stuff and I was able to do it. Lots of different records available to work on. Find something that tickles your fancy and go for it! On the cursive angle, one of the civil war blogs I follow had a post by a researcher who was unable to decipher a hand-written text.  Thought it might have been encoded.   Turns out it was written in a cursive style of Fraktur script used in parts of German Federation at the time. Very neat! Glad they were able to eventually figure it out. It’s exciting in a nerdy sort of way. The cursive handwriting is interesting. My GGF’s had a lot of the s’s that looked like cursive f’s, the ink had soaked through both sides, there were unusual abbreviations, etc. Learned a lot. And every document had different handwriting. Like I said, great brain exercise. Wide range of topics to jump into and contribute to there at National Archives. And the spelling, too! Good puzzlers. On the cursive angle I’m almost 70, so I grew up with pencil and paper – and cursive. I was (before computers) a draftsman so our writing (there is probably a better word to use) was important (all caps but still by hand). But I don’t use it anymore, and haven’t for a long time. I can type about 60+ words a minute, but you can’t read my own signature… If you don’t do it – you lose it – it seems. It’s embarrassing at times to be honest. But now I’m so old and I have a little bitty case of the “shakes” for lack of a better word. It is what it is. I still appreciate people that make hand written stuff so incredibly well done. Part of it I think is their natural talent of art? I have none. :-) hmmmm … could have written the exact same message, right down to the draughtman bit. only difference is even bc (before computers) my hand suffered from the “shakes”. my cursive was so illegible that i resorted to printing and even that was hard to read. My GGF (grampy) could write cursive forward and backward with each hand simultaneously. It took a mirror to proof-read. I wish I had appreciated him and his stale cookies more. Thanks for the endorsement Petal. I’m going to give it a go! More “winter” with plants from Arcimbolo! I had not realized that citrus was a winter fruit – it is in Italy at least. All the orange, lemon, and grapefruit varieties we have bloom in very early spring and mature in winter, although the varieties tend to be on slightly different schedules.  They can stay on the tree for several months so you don’t have to use them all at once, but in a residential setting you risk promoting roof rats if you leave them too long.   Mexican limes seem to do whatever they want and can produce more than one crop in a year, and do not stay on the tree very long. Because citrus normally is evergreen, and because the fruits take a fairly long time to ripen, it turns out that the long bearing time is an advantage and a reason for their success as food plants. “They can stay on the tree for several months…” Aha – that’s what I was missing. I thought they were a spring fruit since I’d seen people picking them fresh in Greece in mid-April.  When I ran across the Arcimbolo portrait I couldn’t figure out why he included the citrus around the neck until I saw a mention that it was because they were winter fruits in Italy, which had me confused since Greece is so close.  Now it all adds up!  The things you don’t know when you live where it’s expected to snow… Lemon trees don’t make a sound\n‘Til branches bend and fruit falls to the ground\nBaby, sweet baby https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4htPUK2q4ZU Very nice! Is that John Prine on back up? Indeed a winter fruit, and those snow-covered oranges are likely ruined 🙁 We lose a lot of citrus trees in the Central Valley when it goes below freezing and warmers aren’t enough, happens about once every 20 years or so. Florida citrus has been hit hard by HLB, the Asian psylid. A very pretty photograph that reminds me of images of persimmon trees in the snow, something seen regularly in Japanese art. But the fruit likely is ruined, as you write, Laughingsong. Trees or crops are not necessarily ruined as the growers had plenty of warning. Any citrus grower worth their salt would know to spray the crop with water; locking the fruit and foliage in ice, thereby creating a mini-environment of relative warmth. The one caveat, however, was the length of the cold spell. Temps below freezing for extended periods will kill or ruin regardless. lyman alpha blob. Italians have definite ideas about the seasonality of citrus fruits. Which was backed up by my fruttivendolo in the market in Via Madama Cristina, who, when I asked her if I could buy eating oranges in mid-April, scoffed: These are barely good enough to use to make spremuta! I paste below a listing from an Italian site. Note that there are many,  many citrus fruits in Italy. Three that are used mainly as aromatics, in preserves and liquors, and perfumes, are citrons, bergamots, and chinotti (bitter oranges). They aren’t in this listing. Limes are something of a novelty, even though there is evidence for limes in Sicily going back hundreds of years. Un mistero d’Italia. The virtue of lemons (as Giuseppe Barbera mentions in his wonderful book Agrumi) is that they come in season later and have a long season. They are more tolerant than other citrus fruits, in a sense. Agrumi in inverno\nÈ la stagione perfetta per il consumo di agrumi. In particolare: Dicembre: arance, mandarini, mandaranci, pompelmi, limoni.\nGennaio: sono ancora disponibili arance, limoni, mandarini, pompelmi.\nFebbraio: ancora tanti agrumi, tranne il pompelmo. Agrumi in primavera In primavera si possono trovare ancora i mandarini ma la polpa solitamente è un po’ asciutta, per il resto si trovano ancora sui banchi del mercato: Marzo: limoni, insieme alle arance e ai mandarini, ancora presenti fino alla fine di aprile.\nMaggio: ultimi arance e limoni, con dimensioni un po’ più piccole, poiché siamo arrivati alla fine della stagione degli agrumi. Agrumi in estate\nAlcune varietà di arance tardive possono essere coltivate ancora fino giugno. Dopo, gli unici agrumi ancora presenti sono i limoni. Agrumi in autunno\nCon la fine dell’estate ci sono ancora i limoni, mentre da novembre anche arance, mandarini, mandaranci e pompelmi. There are dozens of varieties of oranges and lemons, which also affects their seasonality.  Has seasonality of citrus fruits been eliminated completely in the U S of A? Thanks DJG.  Your fruttivendolo’s judgment probably explains the little dustup I saw last April when a customer complained to a Cretan waiter that the fresh squeezed OJ she ordered wasn’t fresh.  I’d seen the waiter pick them fresh off the tree and assumed they’d just ripened.  You’d think the complaintress would have known better, being from another Mediterranean country. Yes, they eventually become bland and watery, but people disagree about exactly when they are best.  I’ve had tolerable grapefruit picked as late as the end of May, and that’s in Phoenix where it’s pretty hot by May. Yes, and depending on varieties the picking season, which is very long, can start as soon as September (clementine mandarines) and end in June (V Midknight oranges). Only in July and August there is no citrus picking. If you have the experience of picking these by yourself when they are mature and eat them immediately with all its flavour and smell you will realise how much one looses with the commercial management of the crop (necessary but a pity). Have not seen any ESL but since I know the normal price of the things I regularly buy then I (and everyone) would notice if the price keeps jumping around. People like Liz Warren must be hard up for talking points. The truth is that retailers do have competition and worry more about price conscious shoppers per the above than pretending their customers can’t simply drive across the street.

There was NO deadly new disease and NO real pandemic.” Oh, there was and is no deadly new disease and no real pandemic? Denial of reality, head in sand, rejection of science, etc, everything is in place to ignore the effects of other epidemics that are creeping up (avian flu being the most threatening, but mpox is worryingly tenacious, and RSV seems to be well-established now). I think that’s one of the bits that is wrong.  But, the idea we’re going to get an official revisionist history  that serves other official purposes, to further the official narrative control, sounds about right to me. I’ll be watching to see if all Western countries come up with almost the same revisionist history, in lockstep as you might say. / ;) I think the point is to blame it on China … and Fauci. A disease that kills 20,000,000 seems deadly to me, but whjat do I know. Are readers seeing any of these “electronic shelf labels (ESLs)? If you’ve got nothing to do during the day, can you stand around and watch the labels change? The topic has already been discussed in comments on this very forum. Personally, I have seen these tags being introduced about three years ago (European country, not USA), and they are now becoming prevalent at least in middle-size to large supermarkets. I saw those labels under update only a couple of times — there were many of them being modified simultaneously, which is why I noticed (and this was early during their introduction in the ALDI supermarket I patronize). What you are more likely to see is Aldi charging the same for eggs as Lidl and vice versa. Perhaps the electronic tags will be used to talk to each other. A probable “price fixing” model there.\nAvoid outright appearances of impropriety and introduce a “Third Party Middleman” company. Say, a “service” that scans prices at all retailers and “compares” the prices for the “convenience” of the managers. Have this done at speed and some “leakage” between customer’s data streams “might happen.” Voila! Instant price “coordination.” Done automatically.\nI would not be at all surprised to read that this is already being done. This is exactly what’s been happening in the US with residential rents. There’s a company that provides “services”  to landlords, including suggested rents. Since this company has visibility across cities and countries, it’s real purpose is to promote collusion and maximize rents while disguising the operation as something else.  If I recall correctly, many class action suits are being launched against this operation; we will see what happens. Locally I purchased a dozen eggs yesterday at a nearby Ingles grocery store, pricing was right at the $4.50 price point.  Hard coded price label…my guess is they have to consistently update the price …And I don’t frequently buy a dozen as it goes. I’ll wait for a friendly reminder from the West Coast or up in the Northeast how that price for the carton of eggs, well it ain’t so bad in comparison. There were no eggs at my Trader Joes tonight and very few for the past couple of months.  I’d have paid twice your 4.50 a dozen.  TJs filled the egg display with other items so you don’t notice they’re out unless you use a shopping list. Do those also talk to, or listen to, whatever is in your wallet or on your phone? Or on your face?\nPay cash, 💵 leave the phone 📱 elsewhere while shopping, wear a hat 🧢 and sunglasses. 😎 That’s why I carry the credit card around in its own little Farraday pouch.

I thought it floundering and miscast. Besides being science fiction the fact that  Villeneuve was not nominated pretty much dooms it. I also find it interesting that the vast majority of comments disagree with the premise that Dune should win.  A friend said after reading the nominations she realized she had no interest in the films or the winners. I don’t think she is alone. I should admit that outside of liking the visuals and music I wasn’t impressed with Dune 1 and still haven’t bothered with Dune 2. And I read Dune at least every five years or so. Re. “Electronic Shelf Labels”… they have been adopted in a local chain hardware store where I live. They were brought in with no notice, and the first time I saw them they were blank in an entire section of the store and blinking nonsense patterns in another due to a software error. (Or a savvy or disgruntled staff member, who knows?) I am keeping an eye on my sample store to see if maybe it’s in a pilot program. In any case, that store and the entire chain has lost me as a customer both live and online. A recent WEF forum was funny on a number of levels.\nYale University Professor Walter Reed said: “I think we need to also factor in not only who has won (Trump) but also who has lost, which is to say us.” “By ‘us,’ I mean the general intellectual, professional, managerial people who believed history was over, and we were merely administering and managing things according to clear and known rules,” he explained. “Something new, not necessarily better, but new, is moving into the center.”\nBut then you had the lady from the Manhattan Institute claiming that neoliberalism raised millions out of poverty–ALLISON SHRAGER: “I think a lot of economists are shaking their heads at this narrative that neoliberalism failed. From their perspective, the world got a lot richer, and even in richer countries, quality of life has improved significantly.”\nMaybe Larry Summers believes that but the reality is that neoliberal financialization impoverished millions of Americans, indirectly resulting in Trump’s election\nFurthermore, China, the leader in bringing people out of poverty, did not follow neoliberal instructions, but developed like the US did by focusing on productive industrial policies rather that extractive neoliberal financialization\nIf the US had followed neoliberal prescriptions we would still be exporting cotton Last I checked, the US is still exporting cotton.\n\nIn fact, the US has often been the #1 exporter of cotton in the world. Roughly a half of US cotton is grown in Texas; Georgia is next, then Mississippi.\nSadly, America no longer uses that cotton. The US spinning mills and clothing factories were all shuttered and sent overseas. So, that America exports a lot of cotton is no surprise. We use little of it here now. Cotton no longer comes to Harlem.\nCotton: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_production_in_the_United_States#/media/File:12-10-2019_US_cotton_harvested_area.jpg My cotton t-shirts hole within months of ownership, cost doesn’t matter. They all do it. There are various theories on the Internet as to why clothing now sucks.

The country’s cotton production rose to 6.164 million tonnes in 2024, a 9.7 percent increase from the previous year, with northwest China’s Xinjiang leading the growth, official data showed Wednesday. The national growth was driven by increased planting area and improved yield efficiency. China’s total cotton planting area expanded by 1.8 percent from 2023, while the yield per unit area saw a significant jump of 7.8 percent year on year, reaching 2,172 kg per hectare, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This improvement in productivity played a crucial role in boosting the country’s overall cotton output. Xinjiang, China’s largest cotton-producing region, saw a 3.3 percent increase in planting area to 2.45 million hectares. In contrast, cotton planting areas in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins decreased by 1.6 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively. Wei Fenghua, an official with the NBS rural department, cited stable target prices in Xinjiang as a key factor in encouraging farmers to increase cotton cultivation. Xinjiang’s cotton yield per unit area rose by 7.6 percent to about 2,324 kg per hectare, benefiting from favorable weather conditions throughout the growing season. China is the world’s leading cotton consumer and producer, and Xinjiang accounts for nearly 90 percent of the country’s total cotton production. The region’s dominance in China’s cotton production has steadily increased in recent years, leveraging its natural advantages and improved irrigation infrastructure… Allison Shrager is doing herself some epic gaslighting here. Saying the diametric opposite of what is true. But I guess that she will get a coupla pats on the head by the people at Davos for saying this. Re: RFK investigating the vaccines. It really does not matter if we think we can have a rational discussion or not. It is becoming increasingly apparent to me as a practicing physician in this country that the choice is now binary.  We can have a completely transparent investigation of every vaccine out there including completely valid safety studies OR we can have a failed and hobbled vaxx program going forward. There are now enough people refusing and resisting any and all vaccines that if we have not already we will soon reach critical mass.   Because of the complete horrific bungling of the last 4 years, the credibility has been completely shot. I had discussions with 4 different rational people today.  All 4 what I would call middle of the road Blue city Dems.  2 were pneumonia shots, one was shingles shots and one was discussing childhood vaccines in their kids, including MMR.  I achieved a complete hard NO on all 4.   People are now profoundly skeptical.  They have seen the problems and the lies.  And they just do not believe the authorities anymore – so again, we are going to have to have a transparent rational investigation OR we will have a hobbled vaccine world going forward.    And it will have to involve the PCPs of America.  People have literally zero trust at this point in the authorities.  And all the naysayers and hangers-on in my profession are going to have to shut up and sit in the car or risk losing it all. > We can have a completely transparent investigation of every vaccine out there including completely valid safety studies I don’t think that option is on the table. Then we will have a hobbled feckless vaccine program going forward.  It really is that simple.  There is just zero trust in a huge segment of the population. Mandating is not going to work going forward – too many charter schools, private schools etc.  They tried to tell this to the Obama admin – no one listened – and now we have home schooling syyrocketing and public schools cratering.  For many reasons, but this one is major.   I also do not think after the debacle that we went through that general population mandating of vaccines will ever be tried again. Public schools and universities will likely continue mandating vaccines but there is a definite trend towards increasing exemptions in kindergarten (2.6% in 21-22 vs. 3.3% in 23-24) and decreasing overall coverage (95% in 19-20 vs 92.5% in 23-24).  https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm Walter Cronkite once said the only thing news companies have to sell is credibility. Doctors too? And Yves has talked about how the business world has suffered from loss of trust versus the time when your word was your bond. Meanwhile Biden’s last act in office is pardoning his family with no apparent concern about his “good name” that the Bard talked about. After all he’ll be gone and we’ll be gone (eventually). Nihilism rules the day. IM Doc: It’s like the Crucible all over again. Americans panicking in face of evidence to the contrary. I’m not sure why anyone wouldn’t risk vaccines that have been proven successful:\n–smallpox\n–MMR\n–tetanus\n–shingles\n–pneumococcus.\n–even the yearly flu vaccine, for all of its faults, isn’t a disaster. Here in the Chocolate City, the region encourages vaccination. For free. I have had flu shots, the Covid booster, shingles, and pneumococcus, all for free. My “medico di base,” who is quite good, has pushed me to go get the shots when the regional health authority has pinged me with appointments.  I am wondering if the fact that Americans have to pay so much is a factor — in the sense that they are forced to pay so much for every aspect of a health-insurance system that isn’t working on their behalf or in their favor. The straw that breaks the camel’s back. Have any of those been migrated to the new mRNA platform? Not yet – but they are rapidly working on mRNA flu vaccines One of the 3 RSV vaccines is mRNA – and that one is assiduously avoided by me.  The mRNAs are so completely tainted that at least for this generation they will be a no-go for anything. If you look at the moderna mRNA RSV numbers compared to the other 2 – they are just simply not being done – people are not interested in these at all. Not surprised. We know how Pfizer and FDA played hide-the-ball with the data on the modified RNA COVID shots, and the downplaying of any side effects, and no one taking you seriously when you reported adverse events from administering these to patients. I had my own moderate reaction, maybe from the second shot, maybe not. But without any viable data, I have to assume it was from the shot, and I won’t get any more modified RNA garbage. It is a shame that they want to roll this platform out for everything. I never thought I’d live to a see an era of mass infectious disease; I grew up during the golden age of public health, when vaccination rates were high, and it seems like disease was taken seriously enough that none of the current debacle was ongoing. So this is all going to be a new world for many people. In my mom’s era, infectious disease was just a fact of life, and they came out with the polio vaccine, and everyone got that, big deal. We conquered small pox. We dealt with mosquito-born illness (by spaying horrible poison causing its own horrors). I doubtless don’t even know about dozens of other initiatives. Today, not so much. Public health is running on brand fumes. It probably has been since before 2020, given the putrid state of much of our public institutions already. The rot at FDA has been apparently for quite awhile. “Public Health” in the USA is dead.\nThousands of years to build trust, destroyed in less than 4 years.\nA betrayal that has devastated many in the Health care field emotionally, including my Sister.\nThe price paid will be enormous and long lasting. For those working to advance the ” Long Jackpot”, the price will be profit.\nAnd all to the good, from their standpoint. >>>I never thought I’d live to a see an era of mass infectious disease; I grew up during the golden age of public health, when vaccination rates were high, and it seems like disease was taken seriously enough that none of the current debacle was ongoing. So this is all going to be a new world for many people. As a son of a nurse and old enough to be affected by measles and rubella as well as knowing people who suffered from polio, not to mention what my older relatives faced, it is sad to know that greed is going to kill or cripple many people, perhaps hundreds of thousands or even millions.  The mRNA vaccines were rushed into use and information on Covid was suppressed for profit over fighting the disease.  And now all vaccines are tainted, even the older ones that are safe and generally needed. How does one explain the past to people today?  That there are good reasons for some vaccines and of how dying even as adults from infectious diseases was the norm a century ago?  Something that vaccines helped stop. Ah yes, there are some very good reasons, imo, for taking  some vaccines. And I have taken most of them. / ;) adding: ‘some’ is not ‘all.’ CDC: ‘We must take every vaccine available, no matter the personal consequences!’ People: ‘What you mean ‘we’, white man.’ Some is not all, but for many people all vaccines are now suspect, which is an understandable overreaction.  The problem is finding a way to explain to people why some vaccines are likely dangerous and to be avoided while others are not and should be taken; I want to find ways to do this. I’m sure greed was the easily manipulated surface-motivation for many of the for-profit players involved in this.   But the deeper motivation behind the thought-leaders like Gebreyesus’s WHO and the political commissars’ CDC and etc. was, is and remains Jackpot Design Engineering to designe, engineer and apply the Long DieOff ( KillOff). Same here, but you have to book flu and Covid. The others are automatic. Free, except for the bus to get there. Heh, the flu shot. I was fortunate in never having ever knowingly gotten the flu, or had any such symptoms that would indicate such had happened. I did get the flu shot for a number of years, always felt awful after. Always told, ha, you can’t get the flu from the flu shot. As if, you know, it doesn’t spur an immune reaction. The lying about shots and the condescension and dismissiveness started quite a bit before this Pandemic debacle. Somewhere along the way, our medical system got very sick, and it is on death’s door today, frankly. When i saw T at the podium lauding Oracle and OpenAI and another computer CEO bro for their big idea of creating personalized cancer vacs – one just for you! – in near instant time, based on AI, I thought it was the nuttiest idea I’d heard in a long time. Electronic Medical Records ought to raise a note of caution.  Wishful thinking meets StarTrek branding for a multi-billion dollar sales pitch. I’m not sensing humility returning to the health care systems any time soon. Project warped speed cubed. the AI version Ha Ha Hee Hee Wishful thinking meets StarTrek branding… On this, even Spock would have likely raised an eyebrow, frowned, and fallen silent. I’m a biochemist and have a patent on an early purification step for an oncolytic adenovirus (work by the brilliant Frank McCormick, PhD, FRS, DSc (Hon) David A. Wood Distinguished Professorship of Tumor Biology and Cancer Research, UCSF) The problem is that mRNA is NOT a vaccine.  It is a gene therapy vector.  The so called mRNA vaccine expressed the spike protein which is the most variable part of the virus and proven to be dangerous when purified and injected into mice.  Vaccines against viruses have been whole dead virus so that the immune system can make antibodies to the capsid proteins that make up the outer structure that contains the nucleic acids that make the virus virulent.  In the 1800s vaccines were whole dead viruses (no way to sterile filter or purify anything back then).  In the 20th century whole dead virus with an adjuvant (which increases the immune response to the antigen while the immune system does not make antibodies to the adjuvant).  I’m 76 and the vaccines I received were proven safe with at least 5 years of clinical trials and observations.  One of the newer vaccine used a peanut extract in production and now we have children with deadly peanut allergies that never existed when I was a child.  Giving large pharma complete legal immunity wrt to vaccines is a CRIME.  We need to use the the older vaccines before pharma was given legal immunity.  From above “we are going to have to have a transparent rational investigation” – YES! ‘One of the newer vaccine used a peanut extract in production and now we have children with deadly peanut allergies that never existed when I was a child.’ Had to wince at that one and I’m just an ordinary dogsbody. But even I could have said that this may have not been a good idea simply based on the number of children with peanut allergies out there. Come to think of it, I have been getting the flu shot the past coupla winters but now may have to find out if they are slipping in mRNA flu shots instead of regular ones. > We need to use the the older vaccines before pharma was given legal immunity Good litmus test I recovered from a nasty flu last year and the day after I recovered I was like… “Man, I’m not taking the flu vaccine next year!” Here we are in January again and looks like I’m holding out. My parents aren’t taking their flu shots anymore. I was never an antivaxxer, and still might update the T-Dap and MMR but that’s about it. My parents didn’t have any issues with vaccines until the covid debacle. I have added orts and scraps. Have a good weekend! re: As a 3rd-party, curious observer, I have several naive, unanswered questions about the Stargate project Isn’t OpenAI the company the young San Francisco AI programmer worked for: the programmer who we’re told suicided himself?  He was on the verge of releasing apparently damning information about the dangerous direction he saw OpenAI taking?  I would love to know what he documented in his files.  The timing of the programmer’s suppose-icide and OpenAI CEO appearing will Ellison and others for a big AI deal is the stuff of mystery novels. Nah … It,s business nothing personal. There is an incredible recent interview from Tucker Carlson with Suchir Balaji’s mother (the Open AI guy who supposedly killed himself). His mother took photos of the crime scene. It was definitely not suicide and there is obviously a coverup happening. It’s well worth watching.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kev_-HyuI9Y&ab_channel=TuckerCarlson $500B for OpenAI, but funding frozen for national supercomputing centers. WTF Call me vindictive. From the Vertlartnic article above: “In response, the 51 former officials signed a letter asserting that “the arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden’s son Hunter … has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” Mind you, the signatories offered no evidence of a hidden Russian hand in all of this. They supplied no digital trails leading to Russian spies, no confidential sources claiming a connection. And they were up-front about this: ‘We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails … are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement—just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.’” You have people with security clearances who are supposedly law enforcement (and sworn to uphold the law) playing office politics and interfering (against the interest of their own agencies) in public affairs.  Hmmm. Could that be called incompetence? Why wouldn’t I revoke their privileges and ease them out the door to spend more time with their families if I became czar of the U S of A? I’m so long popcorn on this one.  Is it wrong to consider the not-one-but-two attempts at assassination here? There’s an uneasiness between “free speech” and “security clearance”, isn’t there? They play it, the spooks; “if it only could be told, you’d understand” Spooks should STFU. Trump brought up the interesting idea that just because you get a security clearance once, there is no reason why it should be for life. It isn’t for ordinary people.  My husband was in the Air Force working on airplanes and had a security clearance.  It was good for 1 year after he left, but if he didn’t get a job that required it, his clearance would expire which is what happened.  My Dad had a Top Secret clearance once upon a time and it expired the same way after he was laid off. Sergeants and Sr. Engineers don’t get the same treatment as important people. > Could that be called incompetence? I believe Hamlet called that “the insolence of office.” There is a Hamlet quote for everything. And every Hamlet production brings some new insight. Back in the 1980s, the National Theatre in London put on a guest production of a Dramaten (Stockholm equivalent of the NT) version directed by Ingmar Bergman.\nIt was by no means sold out and tickets were available at half price from the Leicester Square ticket booth. At the first interval, a group of young French students in the row in front turned to me and asked “this is in very old English, isn’t it?”. “No, it is in Swedish,” I replied. They did not come back after that interval.  It was a modern version, where Hamlet was played as a punk in a leather jacket with a ghetto blaster on his shoulder. Perhaps strangely, even though I am an American, I like Ingmar Bergman. It’s been decades since I watched anything of his.  Maybe I should watch again although they are not light viewing.  But often dark viewing fits dark times That X post above by Nathan J Robinson  on Current Affairs query and saying that all they  got from Bernie was silence… Same thing here when I asked Bernie’s office why he wasn’t supporting Jill Stein in the last election when clearly her platform was mostly aligned with everything he has been espousing all these years. Not that I expected a response from him. Points of related importance: 1)  The New York Times has now printed 5 articles in the last 2 months on how Beijing (always Beijing) is abusing China’s pandas (not the plushy but the real pandas) for reasons that are beyond my understanding but have something to do with Beijing wanting to send pandas (real ones) abroad to take control of zoos everywhere (spy pandas). 2) Paul Krugman resigned from the Times because his articles were being censured and actually changed and rechanged when he tried to remove the changes.  A Nobel Prize winning economist who can longer be permitted to write on the economics he knows as few in the world know economics. You’re a gem CA with many great comments over time but “(spy pandas)” easily takes the crown for my favorite comment you’ve made here. Thanks for making me chuckle! Electronic Shelf Labels: The system could be hacked and a competitor could bankrupt a company by reducing prices; on the Big Brother side governments could instantly be made aware of inflationary moves.  If governments were actually proactive about inflation they would be “bringing executives in for a quiet talk” to explain their suspected and expected price hikes rather than farting around with base rates etc after the fact.  I am sure AI would be a great help with that. Pip-pip! The whole foods near me has electronic price tags. I have not time to stand around and watch them change but they seemed suspicious to me when I first noticed them. They are e-ink displays which can be fairly cheaply sourced I believe but they would certainly need to make back a fair bit of money on the investment in what must be thousands of them by increasing average price paid by consumers. The cost of having a person go round to replace every label when prices or products change is significant. Pretty soon that cost exceeds electronic ones. Right. It’s just another example of management trying to replace a labor function with a robot function. The objectors would be closer to the mark by saying “think of the jobs.” Also some states require retailers to make good if shelf tags disagree with the final price and that’s a concern. This was part of the bargain that permitted the elimination of actual price tags on goods. Not sure which category this belongs to:  B.C. man’s sasquatch-seeking expeditions used against him in spousal support case. (Basic background for those unfamiliar with this bit of regional mythology, aka “Bigfoot”.) Excerpt: A man’s ongoing efforts to track down the elusive sasquatch in remote areas of British Columbia suggest he’s capable of working, and therefore not entitled to spousal support, a judge has ruled. The unusual circumstances were detailed in a recent divorce decision handed down in B.C. Supreme Court, which makes multiple references to the 57-year-old’s sasquatch-seeking expeditions.  It was one such venture that led to the couple’s separation in August 2020. His wife told the court he went on a camping trip on Vancouver Island that month in search of the mythical ape-like creature – and brought along an ex-girlfriend without telling her. Politico is revealed as aggressively quashing any reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop story back when it mattered, and then the same Politico is cited as a source for an article about how RFK Jr.’s allies have a plan to upend the childhood vaccine schedule “according to five people with knowledge of the deliberations who were granted anonymity because the discussions are private.” Ah yes, because nothing screams ‘trustworthy reporting’ like anonymous sources from the same outlet that played defense for the establishment when the truth was inconvenient. Carry on, Politico. > face coverings ‘impair our ability to provide a warm and welcoming atmosphere for our guests and to provide experiences that exceed their expectations.’ I suppose that exposing guests to infection (from asymptomatic spreaders among the employees) with a virus that they didn’t ask for is a way of exceeding what the guests expected. Re: Chef toils alone — Lambert comments “Personally, I think wonderful food should be a perk of being a citizen.”  I agree. But this citizen does not think any of the food described and/or pictured in that story sounds wonderful at all. The oligarchs can have it. We watched the snow waft down last night while we enjoyed  chicken paprikash made by yours truly. Mmm…mmm…good! Chicken paprikash, oh. I imagine Mr. Salaam would enjoy it. I sure would. I also reckon he could make a meal you’d go back for. Maybe not on the 100th floor. He’s cooking for the clientele there.\nLong ago I was food and bev manager at a fancy place. The chef and I became friends, and I’d have him up to the camp for outdoor grill or pizzas. He more than once told me how much he appreciated the simpler fare.\nThis line of thought has got me hankering for a kitchen throw-down, and I’ve got dough sitting.\nChicken paprikash sounds really nice. My mom made the best chicken paprikash, yum yum! Sounded like a tough reality to accept, having climbed the ranks in order to become a top rated chef ( I know so very little about the culinary arts and have never watched The Bear either…).  And as to those locations based where the super elite merely hold a place, it’s the moderate opposite of what Yogi Berra once said…it isn’t busy cause no one really goes… Brings to mind a restaurateur story from my time in Dallas, describing the origins of a new and highly rated barbecue restaurant.   The young couple went from pulling the cooker behind their truck or SUV to running a food truck operation ( it may have been a common market area instead but comparable..) RE: Rubio / Greenwald’s tweet – (first?) Rubio memo via RealClearPolitics: link “The lengthy cable was sent shortly after Rubio arrived at his new post in Foggy Bottom and was obtained exclusively by RealClearPolitics. It signals a fundamental shift in foreign policy and a realignment of all diplomatic efforts toward putting American needs first.” A fundamental shift you say? “Our department will take the lead in revitalizing alliances, strengthening ties with other partners and allies, and countering the malign activities of our adversaries. We will refocus American foreign policy on the realities of today’s reemerging great power rivalry,” Rubio wrote. “And we will explore and creatively exploit the many new and unexpected opportunities that this changing world affords our nation.” For some reason the promise of creative exploitation is making me apprehensive… On that Cassidy Hutchinson post: I assume by “lawmakers” it is referring to actual members of Congress. Do they mean to claim that actual members of Congress propositioned this White House aid, unsolicited (I assume), for “sexual favors” – by TEXT?? I certainly don’t deny that members of Congress are that slimy, but are they really that dumb?  Personally, I didn’t believe Hutchinson’s story about Trump going nuts in the car, which was denied by the driver if I recall. Every time I’d go into our local bookstore I’d see her damn book displayed all over the place, which was irritating. But still… maybe I’m missing something. I looked up the related news stories and there really wasn’t any more information provided. Kamala and others contemplating their futures need to consider the audiences, not potted plants.\nMany saw Trump talk freely for extended periods about many topics without any teleprompter, note cards or handlers. Compare to and contrast with images of Harris and Biden, word salads, confusion and all. Those planning more runs or roles on the big stage have much work to do in the off-season. That will be needed to attempt to counteract the hours of sound bites and memes that buried them previously.\nSometimes it is just the delivery, regardless of the appealing content. I won’t argue against the idea that Harris and the Democrats’ delivery is dog-awful.  But so is the content.  Working class people of all colors know the Democrats hate them;  that’s why they abandoned the party in the elections.  Better “messaging” or “delivery” won’t change a thing, and The Deplorables know this, too. Harris is fully qualified to be Governor of California.\nShe has a tan and nice teeth, is a Female, She is utterly corrupt, lazy and not too bright.\nAnd most importantly, she can raise lots of money.\nThat’s what it takes in the “Golden State” where those with the Gold make the rules. She’s much like governor Gavin “Goodhair” Newsom only without his modest intelligence.  Honestly, despite his corruption and incompetence, I believe that she would be a worse governor than him. I just love this type of “news” and “reporting”……“‘The people [RFK] really trusts are people that obviously are trying to execute a plan to totally take away vaccines,’ said one of the people with knowledge of the discussions. ‘The risk of overreach, I don’t think is zero.’” And: “‘They’re deadly serious,’ said another person with knowledge of the deliberations. ‘He’s going to move on vaccines and I think he feels he has a mandate.’” In other words, Mary said that Bill was there and he heard Mike say he was coming to visit at 8:00. Well, he thought I wouldn’t be here, but I am and he’s late so he must be a flake. I don’t like Mike. A friend of mine in NYC related this: “went to get my Novavax booster today at CVS and had an interesting\nencounter with the pharmacist, Chinese-American, about 50. We were\nchatting while she was prepping my shot and I asked her if she’d heard\nabout any bird flu data or vax research. She said she belongs to some\npharmacist group discussions and people are all freaking out over Trump’s\nactions – she repeated the “he wants to kill us all” thought that we’ve\nall had of late and said that the gov’t wants absolutely no word released\non bird flu propagation or prevention or vaccine development…” Price of eggs is going up some more.

Every single such post I link to gets erased and removed.    Perhaps I should start offering links to items of which I disapprove and which I would like to see get erased.   Then I can see whether I have discovered a hidden super power I never knew I had. It’s not strange that r/pics deleted the post as after all we live in a fabulous economy!  Such lies as that photo should not be allowed on the site site! /Sarc Yesterday, I got my first two cartons of eggs in actual months, which I didn’t even check the price of. I don’t think it was more than $6 something per dozen, but as I was unable to buy them at any price before I ain’t complaining.  But of course pork (all food, utilities, and rent actually) is going up in price faster than my yearly cost of living adjustment in my social security check and I still only qualify for a munificent $29 monthly SNAP (food stamps) allowance being as I am so well off.  The official rate of inflation is a lie and has been for years. Luigi the Adjuster is supposed to such a surprise to the Elites, but I have to ask, do they still believe that anyone believes in their word?  Really, the worse it gets, the more the official (mainstream) press and neutered sites like Reddit insist that the economy is doing just great and that poors are all lazy, lying idiots who should learn to code all while worshipping the billionaires who are such creative geniuses. I am guessing that bird flu is killing at lot of chickens especially as pork seems to be cheaper than chicken for now.  Maybe I should just check the price of beef instead? It’s crazy how expensive the basic necessities are these days, even here in VT, let alone down  in NYC. I see eggs at the supermarkets lowest at five and change. Local eggs can be had for six bucks as can a dozen duck eggs which I consider a deal and probably won’t last as winter grinds on.\nDuck eggs are delicious, the ultimate over-easy. ‘Luigi Mangione did nothing wrong\n@DoctorFishbones\nAfter the election, Michelle Obama couldn’t make it to Jimmy Carter’s funeral or Trump’s inauguration, she did however carve out time to appear on Jennifer Hudson’s show to promote her new book’ https://xcancel.com/DoctorFishbones/status/1882802196439515453#m With 49 second cringe video.

Back on his No Quarter blog many years ago, he spread the rumor that Obama was born in Kenya.\nHe kept pushing it and pushing it.    I read it from Larry Johnson long before I heard it from Trump.    I remember Larry Johnson claiming Michelle was recorded somewhere saying something like “hate Whitey” or something.   Of course no such tape was ever found.    And Larry Johnson has spent maybe hundreds of thousands of words stating and restating the case that George Floyd died from a drug overdose and “knee on the neck” had nothing to do with it.    I’ m not sure how many of Larry Johnson’s rumors and interpretations can be relied upon. It’s not just Larry Johnson.

Of course no such tape was ever found Not that I’m one to bear a grudge, but I remember not joining that dogpile very well. And catching flak for it. Larry Johnson was a Clinton supporter at the time and he was doing this to try favoring Clinton in his own small way in the primary season that year.    I’m not one to bear a grudge either ( heh heh . . . ) Well that was something. Two big questions for me.\nWhat the hell was Michelle Obama wearing?\nDoes the staff do this for many guests? Or was it prepared for her. It was obviously rehearsed. “At the happy place” makes me think it might be a show thing. That alone would make me quit. Ask any doctor who worked in Chicago in the hospitals where she was the lead attorney in the administration.  And I mean any of them – D or R – liberal or conservative. I think it is safe to say that most would be absolutely shocked about the decisions that were made, who got care and who didn’t, and the immense sums of cash and where they went. In a rational world, there would be a lot to be answered for.  We, however, do not live in a rational world. When I began to truly digest these stories is when I realized that we are governed by really not nice people.  You can cut the hypocrisy with a chain saw when you ponder these stories compared to her speech at the DNC this summer. The more I learn about both Obamas, the more I realize his election was one of the biggest if not the biggest bait and switch con ever pulled on the American people.  As far as national politics, America is certainly proving the rotten apples rise to the top is the standard. Part of the con was running McCain/Palin against him.    A lot of people were afraid ” bomb bomb Iran” McCain wanted to blow the world off its axis in order to make his mark on history.\nAnd if we survived 4 years of McCain, we were looking at 8 years of President Palin after that.    A lot of voting citizens did not want that to happen.    But yes, a lot of us ( and myself as well) were indeed fooled about the depth of Obama’s cold unfeeling Draculoid evil. Hegseth confirmed with Vance as tie breaker. He’s at or near the top of my personal bingo card, for high ranking Cabinet position to be one of the first to be shown the exit to the stage right.  Yeah he did serve so he’s got that in his favor but you’re now in charge of the national armed forces….you’re not just running a small business FFS or talking about our military intelligence and operations on Fox. I don’t conceive that Mr. Hegseth has the chops, if I’m being honest. I for one am willing to give Hegseth the benefit of doubt. Looks like an adult in the room at the White House . . .

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? And four other burning bird flu questions, answered. by  Jess Craig Bird flu is surging in the US again and has, once again, sent egg prices skyrocketing. Nearly 13 million birds have been infected or culled in the past month alone, contributing to shortages. A carton of eggs today costs more than $4 on average, up from about $2.50 a year ago.  Prices aren’t the only thing making headlines — the virus has recently taken a human life, too. After nearly three years of warnings from leading public health and animal agriculture experts that bird flu was becoming a threat to human beings, Louisiana health officials reported earlier this month that an individual died from the virus, the first reported human death in the US from bird flu.  This particular strain of bird flu, H5N1, has been circulating in the US and infecting poultry since February 2022. So far, millions of birds have been infected or were culled to prevent further spread. But, as Vox reported previously, the concern has always been that this strain could jump from birds, then to another animal, and then to humans, and evolve along the way into something much deadlier to humans.  Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week. Last March, the virus made its way to US dairy cows. About a month later, Americans began getting infected in greater numbers — the majority of those infected, health officials say, were exposed to commercial cattle or poultry farms. Today, nearly 1,000 cattle herds across 16 states have been affected, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The deceased Louisiana patient, however, was infected by backyard poultry wild birds. The individual was older than 65 years old and had underlying medical conditions, which likely increased their risk for severe disease and death, as it does for conventional flu. This case brings the total number of documented human infections in the US to 67. Human infections have been reported in 10 states so far, but most cases have occurred in California, where the governor declared a state of emergency in December.  As much as the death set off alarm bells, the risk to most people in the US from bird flu remains very low. Humans aren’t catching bird flu from one another right now. That could always change, though. The H5N1 virus could mutate in some way that makes it easily transmissible between humans. This is how a flu pandemic would begin. And as long as that possibility remains, it’s easy to feel as though not enough is being done to prevent the possibility of another terrible pandemic, especially when influencers are touting raw milk as a potential, natural “medicine” for various ailments (it’s not) or when official government responses feel unclear or insufficient. (There is some truth to that.) From egg prices and vaccines to pandemic potential and disease monitoring, here are five answers about the ongoing response to bird flu. Bird flu mostly spreads among wild and domestic birds, but the virus sometimes does spill over and infect other animals. In the past three years, bird flu has infected cows, seals, bears, dogs, cats, and a number of other mammals. As with any major disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are working alongside state agencies to track cases in humans. But because most people eat animals for food, there are two other key players involved: the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The USDA leads federal efforts to monitor and contain bird flu among farm animals, live bird markets, backyard flocks, and wild animals. The agency develops biosafety and biosecurity standards to prevent the spread of bird flu, and then assists state agencies and commercial farmers to implement those measures. In addition, the agency runs a bird flu surveillance program that involves trapping wild birds, collecting samples from them, and testing them for H5N1 and other pathogens. Wild birds are a reservoir for bird flu, meaning that the virus is normally spread among them and from there spills over to infect domestic birds and other mammals.  Farmers and poultry or cow owners who suspect their flock or herd is infected with bird flu can report the cases to the USDA and to state animal health officials or to their veterinarian, who can then report the cases up the chain. The USDA has a network of laboratories that tests samples from flocks and herds across the country for H5N1 and other pathogens.  But while this might seem like the USDA has broad reach to closely monitor poultry and cattle across the country, it is, in reality, a deeply faulty system. A lot of farmers don’t report illnesses to their veterinarian or state health officials, citing distrust in the government or because they think the epidemic is a hoax. Other farmers do not allow veterinarians to test their flocks or herds for the virus.  If bird flu is detected on a farm or in a live bird market, the USDA mobilizes funding and personnel to those areas to cull — in particularly gruesome ways, such as spraying birds with a water-based foam to suffocate them or closing barn vents and causing birds to die of heat stroke — and dispose of infected animals to prevent further spread. Cows are spared this horrific end because they don’t get so severely sick from bird flu and are too expensive to kill en masse.  While the USDA works closely with the agricultural sector, the FDA is more consumer-facing, ensuring food products are safe. The FDA monitors egg-laying chickens and those slaughtered for meat for signs of infection. Commercial eggs are tested for H5N1 before they are transported to grocery stores and animals are inspected before and after slaughter for any signs of disease. (We’ll get to how effective this process is in the next section.) Since the beginning of the outbreak, the FDA has also led a number of studies to test dairy products for H5N1 and to determine how to make contaminated dairy products safe for consumption. The administration also funds academic researchers to test methods for killing the virus in dairy products and even to experiment with gene-edited chickens that are immune to H5N1.  The CDC, meanwhile, monitors H5N1 infections among humans, tracks people who were exposed to infected animals, and investigates each reported case to determine how the person was infected and if any close contacts of the infected person may also be at risk of contracting bird flu.  State health departments are required to report cases to the CDC; doctors and physicians are, in turn, mandated to report H5N1 cases to state health departments. The CDC also gathers and analyzes data from emergency departments around the US to understand if there might be an uptick in H5N1 cases. But, as we have seen with Covid and Mpox, this system does not always function perfectly, or at times even well, because of reporting lags and a lack of infrastructure or human resources. The CDC also runs a wastewater surveillance system and regularly tests wastewater samples from hundreds of collection sites for H5N1.  Although the FDA, USDA, and CDC might seem to have all the legislation, policies, monitoring, and surveillance programs in place, federal government agencies seem to have resigned themselves to largely sitting back and watching this epidemic unfold. Veterinarians and public health experts have criticized the USDA for prioritizing industry profits and exports instead of rolling out a vaccination program that may have prevented bird flu from spilling over into cows or humans in the first place. The USDA has also failed to take obvious measures such as shutting down cross-state transportation of cattle, which has led to hundreds of infected herds in multiple states.  Other efforts — such as the USDA’s national milk testing program — have been too little, too late and still do not require mandatory participation from every US state where bird flu has been reported. And while most of the failure to contain bird flu lies with the FDA and USDA, the CDC has not pushed to expedite research and development for a bird flu vaccine in humans, which might be needed if the disease becomes more widespread and more severe in people, especially farm workers in close contact with infected animals.  It’s currently unclear what new policies the Trump administration might usher in to combat bird flu in humans or animals. President Donald Trump has vowed to cut federal funding which may impact how the various federal agencies operate. Concerningly, on Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered staff at agencies including the CDC and FDA to pause external communications, including social media and web posts, to the public.  The USDA forecasts that egg prices will continue to rise through the first few months of 2025 before dropping to about half the peak price, according to the agency’s January forecasts. However, new or expanding outbreaks in the US could disrupt this. In short, it’s very unlikely that the average American will contract bird flu from consuming milk, eggs, cheese, meat, or other animal products. Although the FDA found last year that about 20 percent of milk, cheese, and other dairy products contained genetic material from the bird flu virus, researchers at the agency also confirmed that pasteurization — the process of briefly heating milk — kills the virus. Fortunately, 99 percent of the country’s milk supply comes from farms that participate in the agency’s milk safety program which mandates that milk is pasteurized. This means that buying milk or cheese from a grocery store in the US is a safe bet. To be sure, check the label to make sure it contains the word “pasteurized.”  What might be riskier is buying milk from noncommercial farms, like a vendor at your local farmers market or your neighbor down the street who sells milk or cheese out of their house. If that vendor or neighbor pasteurizes their milk, then you’re probably good to go.  There is also a growing trend of consuming raw milk, or milk that has not been pasteurized. Some social media influencers claim that raw milk is healthier than pasteurized milk. A handful of scientific studies have even reported a link between consuming “farm” milk, which sometimes includes raw milk, with a lower risk of developing allergies and asthma. The FDA has, however, debunked many of the health claims associated with raw milk and further warns that drinking raw milk may expose people to H5N1 and a host of other disease-causing pathogens. (Between 1998 and 2018, consuming raw milk caused more than 2,600 illnesses, more than 200 of which required hospitalization.)  So, your best bet is to avoid drinking raw milk and stick to the pasteurized stuff.  Eggs and chicken are also safe to consume. Avian influenza causes such severe disease in chickens and other egg-producing poultry that infected animals are most likely too sick to even produce eggs. But even if sick chickens were producing eggs or were slaughtered for their meat, all commercial poultry flocks in the US are monitored for signs of infection. All eggs are tested for H5N1 before they are transported to grocery stores and animals are inspected before and after slaughter for any signs of disease. But such inspections aren’t 100 percent foolproof. While the FDA also requires eggs to be tested for other pathogens such as salmonella before they leave the farm, outbreaks of those diseases still occur from time to time. (A salmonella outbreak in 2024, for instance, spanned 12 states and landed 34 people in the hospital.) This may be, in part, because not every single egg is tested for salmonella. Egg producers are required only to test a representative sample of eggs from each batch. Eggs can also be contaminated during packing or transportation from the farm to the grocery store.  The good news is that cooking eggs and meat to recommended temperatures and using proper precautions when handling eggs or meat (like washing your hands after handling them) would also kill the bird flu virus.  Currently, there are no bird flu vaccines available for humans or poultry or cows. The CDC has developed a few vaccine candidates for humans that the agency says could be used to develop a vaccine. Additional data regarding the vaccine’s effectiveness has not been released. According to the CDC, the annual flu shot offers no protection against bird flu, but it is unclear if or how the agency actually tested this.  While it is critical for the US government to continue funding vaccine research and development in case a deadlier pandemic emerges, the CDC says there is not an immediate need for widespread vaccination efforts. There have been fewer than 100 documented human infections in the US in the past year. This is likely an undercount given that farm workers are most likely to be infected and may be less likely to seek medical treatment. But more importantly, health officials have documented only three severe bird flu cases, and only one case resulted in death. Globally, there have been nearly 1,000 H5N1 infections among humans between 2003 and 2024, and about half of those people died.  Any threat from the virus now has to be weighed against potential side effects of vaccines, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a condition triggered by an infection that causes the immune system to attack nerves. Given that the current H5N1 strain is causing mostly mild disease, then, at least as of right now, most people would not need to get vaccinated against bird flu even if a vaccine was available.  However, this could change rapidly. Any day, the H5N1 virus might mutate to spread from person to person or to cause more severe illness, in which case vaccination might become an important tool.  Another approach for vaccination might be to only vaccinate farm workers and other populations who are exposed to infected birds or cattle, and therefore at a higher risk of developing bird flu. Last year, Finland adopted this approach and started offering bird flu vaccines to farm workers.  Perhaps the better question to ask here is why we aren’t vaccinating birds or cows against bird flu. I posed that question to infectious disease experts and an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization last May. I learned that, in short, vaccinating poultry against bird flu would impact trade and would require US trade agreements with foreign countries to be rewritten. The veterinarians I interviewed were particularly frustrated with this reasoning. “I’m a poultry veterinarian, and as a veterinarian, I don’t like the idea that you tell me to go fight the biggest fight of my career and you say, here’s your gun; first, let’s unload it. Now, go,” Carol Cardona, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine, told me last year. Last week, the USDA said it was beginning to stockpile bird flu vaccines for use in poultry but still hasn’t pushed for actual vaccination efforts. The USDA has a history of this. During the 2014–2015 bird flu outbreak, the US government stockpiled almost 5 million doses of a vaccine for poultry but never used them. But because bird flu, like the seasonal flu, is a rapidly mutating virus, those vaccines are now useless. In the US, bird flu has been circulating among birds for nearly three years now and has been sporadically spreading from birds to humans for about a year. It hasn’t caused a widespread pandemic among humans yet. That might indicate that the potential for a future pandemic is low, but, in truth, scientists and public health officials really aren’t great at predicting or even understanding why certain viruses suddenly escalate into uncontrollable worldwide outbreaks.  The key ingredient this epidemic needs to become a widespread pandemic among people is human-to-human transmission. So far, there have been no documented instances of this. For this reason, the CDC says that bird flu presents a low risk to the general public. Farm workers, hunters, and other people who come into contact with wild birds, poultry, and cows are at a higher risk of contracting H5N1.  However, while the risk to most people might be low now, the longer the epidemic in poultry continues and the more opportunities the virus has to adapt to spread amongst humans, the more likely the risk for a pandemic becomes.

This study investigates the financial implications of extreme heat waves on stock returns in Europe and the United States. Accordingly, the study combines meteorological and stock market data by integrating methodologies from both climate science and finance. The authors use meteorological data to ascertain the five strongest heat waves since 1979 in Europe and the United States, respectively, and event study analyses to capture their effects on stock prices across firms with varying levels of environmental performance. The findings reveal a marked increase in the frequency of heat waves in the 21st century, reflecting global warming trends, and that European heat waves generally have a higher intensity and longer duration than those in the United States. This study provides evidence that extreme heat waves reduce stock values in both regions, with portfolio declines of up to 3.1%. However, there are marked transnational differences in investor reactions. Stocks listed in the United States appear more affected by the most recent heat waves compared to those further in the past, whereas the effect on European stock prices is more closely tied to event intensity and duration. For the United States sample only, the analysis reveals a mitigating effect of high corporate environmental performance against heat risk. This study introduces an innovative interdisciplinary methodology, merging meteorological precision with financial analytics to provide deeper insights into climate-related risks.

Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. 2023 was the warmest year on record in the United States (U.S.) and the second warmest on record in Europe [1]. Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is evidenced by a consistent upward trend in global mean temperatures [2]. This shift towards a warmer climate is associated with a higher occurrence of extreme weather events and an increased probability of future record-breaking heat waves [3–5]. The sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report recently confirmed the high likelihood of human influence since the 1950s being the cause of increases in the frequency and the magnitude of heat waves [6]. Previous heat waves have caused physical and mental health risks [7–9], excess mortality [10, 11], and done devastating damage to natural ecosystems [12]. Heat event occurrences also result in an increase in the risk of loss of livelihoods as well as in food- and water-borne diseases [6]. Financial markets research has only recently begun to account for such climate-induced risks. Bansal et al. [13] show that rising temperature is a source of long-term economic risk and is reflected in stock prices. Accordingly, the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather no longer passes unnoticed by the stock market [14] and investors’ interest in understanding climate risks to firm values has grown [15–17]. However, recent studies have found that investors tend to underestimate physical climate risks [18, 19]. These are risks that arise directly from the effects of changes in the climate on economic activity [20]. Moreover, the effect of extreme weather events, which fall into the category of physical climate risks, on firm values remains underexplored in the literature [21]. Venturini [22] highlights gaps in climate finance research, particularly the lack of interdisciplinary approaches or integration of meteorological methods for studying extreme weather events such as heat waves. Previous event studies in climate finance have largely overlooked primary temperature data and meteorological methodologies in assessing the impact of extreme temperatures on stock prices [23–25]. Furthermore, these studies classify portfolios by industry affiliation or location rather than by firms’ individual environmental performance, focus exclusively on the U.S., and predominantly report insignificant stock price reactions. To address the research gaps concerning stock price reactions to physical climate risks arising from meteorologically defined heat waves, portfolio clustering by corporate environmental performance, and a comparative analysis of European and U.S. markets, the authors pose the following research question: How do stock markets react to major European and U.S. heat waves, taking into account corporate environmental performance? In addressing this question, the study aims to determine whether these heat waves heighten investors’ awareness of global warming in the respective regions. Using meteorological data, this study identifies the five most severe heat waves for Europe and the U.S., respectively, since 1979, totaling ten heat waves overall. Employing event study methodology, the study then examines how the European and U.S. stock markets reacted to these. Based on the constituents of the Stoxx Europe 600 and S&P 500, the study analyzes the significance of abnormal returns (ARs) using six event windows (EWs). The stock price effects are assessed for portfolios built upon environmental performance grading by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The results reveal a rise in the frequency of heat waves, that heat waves in the U.S. are of lower intensity and shorter duration than those in Europe, and that both stock markets reacted negatively to the major heat waves. In Europe, the intensity and duration of heat waves drive the stock price reactions, while in the U.S., however, it is the more recent heat waves that have tended to have had a greater impact on stock prices, regardless of their intensity and duration. As expected, in the U.S. stock market, firms with high environmental performance exhibit the least selling pressure, while those with poor performance experience the most. Surprisingly, the opposite pattern is observed for Europe. This study makes a significant contribution to research as the first to integrate an analysis of major historical heat waves with an examination of stock price reactions. By combining methodologies from meteorology and finance, it introduces a novel research approach, fostering opportunities for interdisciplinary analysis. The results of this study open new ways for investors, firm managers, and policymakers to understand the interplay between extreme weather events, environmental awareness, and investment decisions. In particular, future research could extend this interdisciplinary approach to samples from developing countries that are especially vulnerable to heat risks, as well as to the analysis of heat-sensitive sectors. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The second section provides a literature review and accordingly derives the hypotheses. The third section describes the interdisciplinary approach based on the methodologies from meteorology and finance. The fourth section presents and interprets the findings of the meteorological and event study analyses. The fifth section discusses the study’s findings, comparing the results with previous research, outlining their implications for practice and contributions to research, acknowledging the study’s limitations, and suggesting avenues for future research. Lastly, the sixth section presents the conclusions. 2023 was the world’s warmest year on record [1]. The latest IPCC report strongly indicates that human activity has significantly contributed to the rise in both the frequency and severity of heat waves [6]. Nevertheless, a research gap remains in exploring heat waves in Europe and the U.S., particularly in comparing these regions and assessing whether models about the link between global warming and heat wave occurrences hold true when analyzing historical patterns. Moving from the “current” climate to a “future” climate by shifting the mean of the whole distribution towards higher temperature values not only implies a generally warmer climate, but is also inevitably connected to a higher probability of the occurrence of extremely warm temperatures and of high record-breaking temperatures [26]. Observations confirm theoretical assumptions of an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat events due to the climate change-induced rise in the temperature mean [4, 5, 27]. Further enhanced values in terms of the probability of occurrence as well as the absolute temperature are possible through an increase in the variance of the “future” climate [28]. Climate projections using different degrees of global warming provide evidence that the increase in the global mean surface temperature is associated with an increase in heat events over Europe and North America [6, 27, 28]. Accordingly, the authors propose with Hypothesis 1a (H1a) that more heat events have occurred in the two regions of interest (Europe and the U.S.) in recent decades, and with Hypothesis 1b (H1b) that the severity of the heat waves has increased for more recent occurrences: Heat risk is also associated with significant financial distress for firms. Graff Zivin and Neidell [29] find that higher temperatures reduce labor productivity and Dell et al. [30] that they reduce economic growth rates. IPCC modelling scenarios predict that the U.S. and Europe will likely experience adverse effects on food production due to global warming [6]. Similarly, extreme heat events have been shown to have devastating impacts on agriculture [31] and general economic output [32]. Addoum et al. [23] confirm that extreme temperature affects earnings of various industries, while Bansal et al. [13] show that rising temperature is a source of long-term economic risk and is reflected in stock prices. Consequently, the stock market is increasingly responsive to the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events [14]. However, the effect of extreme weather events on stock prices is understudied [21]. Most event studies on physical climate risk events and stock price effects focus predominantly on U.S. portfolios [15, 23–25, 33, 34] and there is a notable lack of European samples. Europe provides an interesting setting due to its pioneering role in environmentalism and climate protection as outlined in Teutrine et al. [35], which may indicate a high investor awareness regarding climate risks in this region. Reboredo and Ugolini [36] provide evidence that European stocks are generally more sensitive to climate risks than U.S. stocks, but Schuster et al. [37] find the opposite pattern. Thus, the research field remains inconclusive to date. Building on the existing literature, the authors propose that the impact of heat waves on stock prices reflects the physical climate risk exposure of firms [21, 22]. Previous studies suggest that physical climate risk events can result in economic damage and that such events, accordingly, negatively influence the stock market. Bourdeau-Brien and Kryzanowski [24] reveal that extreme weather events increase stock volatility in the U.S. market and Griffin et al. [21] demonstrate that U.S. firms experience negative market responses during extreme high surface temperature events, and that these effects are intensified by extended durations of such events. Moreover, recent research provides evidence that investors’ awareness of climate change increases when physical climate risks are prominent. Alekseev et al. [38] analyzed Google trends and demonstrated that extreme heat events positively impact climate change awareness. This heightened awareness can result in stock market overreactions, as evidenced by recent findings in the context of natural disasters in the U.S. [39, 40]. The enhanced climate concerns tend to lead to negative investor responses in the stock market [21, 37]. Overall, the intensity and duration of heat events likely influence not only the extent of economic damage but also the level of public attention to heat risk, both of which, in turn, affect the degree of negative impact on stock prices. Consequently, the authors derive Hypothesis 2a (H2a) and Hypothesis 2b (H2b): Additionally, the enhanced sensitization to global warming is considered to be incorporated by investors in investment policies, leading to a preference for firms with high environmental responsibility. This pattern is confirmed for the U.S. stock market [40, 41]. Nevertheless, the European stock market may be even more sensitized to global warming than the U.S. market: European Union regulations aimed at combating climate change are making firms’ environmental responsibility directly financially relevant to investors [42]. Investors in the U.S. stock market tend to be more skeptical about the financial benefits of green investing [37] and have generally shown less commitment to incorporating firms’ environmental performance into their investment decisions, largely due to less stringent climate policies [43, 44]. Joireman et al. [45], Deryugina [46], and Rüttenauer [47] find that high temperatures positively influence belief in global warming. Especially in such periods, the level of firms’ environmental responsibility may influence the impact of heat risk on stock prices. From an asset-pricing perspective, low-carbon portfolios are linked to lower expected returns, driven by (sustainable) investors’ non-pecuniary preference to accept reduced returns for holding green stocks [48, 49]. However, previous research shows that green stocks outperform in the short term when the market is salient to climate risks [50–52]. Ardia et al. [53] show that when media attention concerning physical climate risk is high, green stock values increase while brown stock values decrease. Choi et al. [41] find that Google searches related to global warming increase during periods of unusually high temperatures and that carbon-intensive firms underperform compared to low-emitting firms. Moreover, Huynh and Xia [40] show that U.S. listed firms with high environmental performance experience lower selling pressure during periods with high investor awareness to natural disasters. Complementing this, Ai and Gao [54] and Barbera-Marine et al. [55] confirm that firms’ environmental performance has a mitigating effect on their exposure to climate risks. Further studies provide evidence that green stocks outperform the market after climate-related shocks [19, 41]. Accordingly, it is expected that investors also consider firms’ existing levels of environmental responsibility when making investment decisions in response to, as yet under-researched, heat risk events. Following recent findings by Schuster et al. [37], the authors derive Hypothesis 3 (H3), that portfolios with superior environmental performance outperform their peer portfolios when climate risk events are salient to investors. The large number of parameters involved in describing a heat wave (e.g., intensity, frequency, duration, spatial extent) has and continues to pose a great challenge for the scientific community in agreeing on a universally applicable heat wave metric. Consequently, various definitions exist, focusing either on a single or multiple parameters [56]. This study employs a multi-parameter-based heat wave definition, the Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId), introduced by Russo et al. [57] and applied in studies thereafter [e.g., 58, 59]. The HWMId is based on the daily maximum temperature data (TX) from 1979 onward—when reliable reanalysis data became available as a result of satellite coverage by the ERA5 reanalysis product. The data are provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and described in Hersbach et al. [60]. The temperature data of the ERA5 reanalysis are defined at grid points that have a uniform horizontal coverage with a resolution of 1.5° longitude x 1.5° latitude. The HWMId is defined for each grid point of the European and U.S. land masses. A heat wave is defined on a single grid point if TX exceeds a daily threshold for at least three consecutive days. The daily threshold refers to the 90th percentile of the reference data set Ad representing the union of all TX within the 32-year long reference period from 1979 to 2010 and within a 31-day window centered on the day d:\n Once a heat event is identified, the corresponding daily heat wave magnitudes Md for a specific grid point are defined as follows:\n\nwhere Td refers to TX on a particular heat wave day and T32y25p and T32y75p represent the 25th and 75th percentile of the distribution of the 32 annual maximum temperatures within the reference period of 1979 to 2010. The unit of Md is expressed as the magnitude relative to the interquartile range of the distribution of the 32 annual maximum temperatures. The total magnitude of all heat waves identified in a year is obtained by summing up the daily magnitudes Md for all days comprising a heat wave, respectively. The HWMId refers to the particular heat wave with the highest total magnitude in a year. Hence, the HWMId measure combines duration (days comprising a heat wave) and intensity (daily heat wave magnitude Md). This study considers the top five heat waves in Europe and the U.S., respectively. These are identified using the grid point with the highest annual HWMId (maximum HWMId) as the primary condition. A sufficient spatial extent serves as a secondary condition (at least 10% of the grid points are required to have a HWMId >6 relative to all grid points encompassing the European or U.S. domain). Through this approach, the study intentionally excludes small-scale phenomena that are not considered to be high-impact heat waves. The authors employ the event study methodology proposed by MacKinlay [61] and utilize the corresponding Stata codes provided by Ullah et al. [62]. Accordingly, the authors follow the following steps: (1) define events, EWs, and portfolios; (2) estimate normal returns; (3) calculate ARs; and, (4) test the portfolios for statistical significance. First, the study identifies the strongest heat wave for each year represented by the HWMId, selecting the top five in each geographical region since 1979. The day of the strongest daily heat wave magnitude Md within the respective top five heat waves is defined as the heat wave peak and serves as the respective event date. A time window around the event date defined in this manner is most likely associated with the period of the strongest attention to this particular heat event [63]. The same six EWs surrounding each heat wave peak are tested: [−5, −1], [−3, +1], [−1, +1], [−1, +3], [+1, +5], and [−5, +5]. This allows for the comparison of heat waves with varying durations. The sample is constructed based on firms listed in the Stoxx Europe 600 and S&P 500, using LSEG Eikon as the data source for daily stock returns. For each event date, the constituents of both indices are clustered according to the environmental performance grades from LSEG (assessed using three categories: resource use, emissions, and environmental innovation), classified in the range of A+ to D- based on previously calculated environmental scores [64]. Following Birindelli and Chiappini [42] and Schuster et al. [37], the authors categorize grade A as a high score, B as medium, and C and D as low. As an illustrative overview of the sample distribution, for the year 2021, most European firms were assessed as high scorers, while most U.S. firms were medium scorers (Table 1).  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318166.t001 Second, the authors compute the normal returns with the market model which assumes a linear relation between the security and the market return [65]:\n(1)\nwhere E(Rit) represents the expected return on security i on day t; Rmt the return on the market portfolio; αi the alpha as the mean return over the period not explained by the market; βi the beta of firm i; and εit the zero mean disturbance term. Model coefficients are estimated from the estimation window, which ranges from -150 to -51 days preceding the event dates. Thus, the estimation period takes place before the start of the respective heat waves. Accordingly, the authors run a regression with daily stock returns for each firm i, Rit, on the market return, Rmt, which is proxied by the Stoxx Europe 600 and the S&P 500, respectively. Third, the authors calculate the abnormal return (AR) for each firm i, which is defined as the residual between expected normal and actual stock return at time t [61]:\n(2)\nwhere ARit represents the AR of i on day t. Thereafter, the ARs are accumulated for each firm i to produce cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) with t1, t2 referring to the EW thresholds:\n(3) Fourth, the authors test the null hypothesis H0 [61]. To test the statistical significance of the CARs, a two-sided t-test is performed. The parametric test examines H0 by indicating that the CARs are zero:\n(4)\nN is the number of days in the respective EW. To evaluate the average effect of the heat waves on the various environmental grade portfolios, the cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) for the three groups (A-rated, B-rated, and C- and D-rated) is computed. The CAAR is defined as the mean of the CARs [66]:\n(5)\nN represents the number of firms in each portfolio. The focus is on the CAARs at the end of each EW [67]. To ensure the robustness of the results through nonparametric testing, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied [68]. The top five European heat waves occurred in 2010, 2014, 2018, 2021, and 2022 (Figs 1 Panel A and 2a). The 2022 heat wave is included due to its exceptionally long duration rather than its daily heat wave magnitudes (Md) which are relatively low compared with the other four (Table 2). The top five European heat waves all occurred in the past two decades (Fig 2a). This confirms a tendency towards a higher frequency of heat waves over the European continent [69]. Accordingly, H1a is accepted for Europe due to the increasing heat wave frequency resulting from climate change. H1b, however, must be rejected since the 2010 heat wave had a higher magnitude (HWMId value: 144.2) than the more recent top five heat events listed in Table 2. This figure shows the HWMId of the top five heat waves identified for each grid point on land within the European (10°W-40°E, 35–70°N) and the U.S. (70–125°W, 30–50°N) domains. The maps were created using the PlateCarree projection from the Cartopy Python package. Additional details for creating the figure can be found in the study’s minimal data set (see S1 File).\n This figure shows the HWMId of the top five heat waves identified for each grid point on land within the European (10°W-40°E, 35–70°N) and the U.S. (70–125°W, 30–50°N) domains.

In general, U.S. heat waves are characterized by lower HWMId values than European ones (Fig 2). This phenomenon is explained by U.S. heat waves’ shorter durations (Table 2). The most severe U.S. heat wave took place in 2023 (Fig 2b and Table 2). The top five U.S. heat waves also took place in the 21st century, suggesting an imprint of climate change in this domain as well (Fig 2). Hence, H1a is also accepted for the U.S. Considering the 2023 heat event, H1b can further be accepted for the U.S., as this heat wave, the most recent, has the highest magnitude of the top five heat waves (HWMId value of 51.2, see Table 2). The authors report statistically significant stock price reactions to each of the top five European heat waves. Encompassing all event windows, heat events, and portfolios, more negative than positive statistically significant stock price reactions are observed (Table 1 and Fig 3). Therefore, H2a is confirmed. The CAARs vary between 1.997% (EW [−5, −1], 2022, low-score portfolio) and -1.874% (EW [−1, +1], 2022, low-score portfolio) (Table 1). Table 2 summarizes and compares all heat waves by HWMId maximum, duration, and the number of statistically significant stock market reactions. Interestingly, as presented in Table 2, the stock market reactions depend on the severity of European heat waves: the highest number of statistically significant CAARs occurred for the 2010 (highest maximum HWMId) and the 2022 (longest duration) heat waves. Accordingly, H2b, which states that stock price reactions depend on the duration and intensity of heat waves, is confirmed for Europe. In contrast, the timing (year) of the heat waves does not seem to influence the effect size or frequency of statistically significant CAARs (Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, investors’ reactions to European heat waves do not appear to have increased for more recent events. Surprisingly, firms with poor environmental performance were barely penalized by investors. In fact, the most positive stock price reactions occurred for firms with low environmental performance and the most negative for firms with high environmental performance (Fig 3). Thus, overall, European firms with superior environmental performance experience stock underperformance during heat waves. This leads to a rejection of H3, proposing an outperformance by environmentally high-scoring firms, for Europe. The underperformance may be attributed to a dilution effect of corporate environmental performance in Europe due to the comparatively high proportion of European firms in the high-scoring portfolio. It should be noted that in 2010 and 2014 the number of firms in each environmental grade portfolio was more equally distributed. During these two European heat waves, the expected mitigation effect of high environmental performance was evident (Table 1).  This figure presents an aggregated view of statistically significant stock price reactions, categorized according to environmental grade portfolios. The delineation covers all identified heat waves and EWs and is segmented into the whole sample, Europe, and the U.S. Statistically significant negative CAARs are listed as negative stock price reactions. Statistically significant positive CAARs are listed as positive stock price reactions.\n  This figure presents an aggregated view of statistically significant stock price reactions, categorized according to environmental grade portfolios. The delineation covers all identified heat waves and EWs and is segmented into the whole sample, Europe, and the U.S. Statistically significant negative CAARs are listed as negative stock price reactions. Statistically significant positive CAARs are listed as positive stock price reactions. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318166.g003 Statistically significant stock price effects are identified for all U.S. heat waves (Table 1). The frequency of statistically significant CAARs is even higher than for Europe, although the maximum HWMId and the duration of the heat waves are on a lower level (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig 3). The tendency for more negative than positive statistically significant stock price reactions is even more pronounced in the U.S. than in Europe, thus also supporting H2a for the U.S (Table 1 and Fig 3). The CAARs range from 1.936% (EW [+1, +5], 2011, low-score portfolio) to -3.065% (EW [−5, +5], 2021, high-score portfolio) (Table 1). In contrast to the results for Europe, neither the maximum HWMId nor the duration of the heat waves had a significant influence on the presence of stock price reactions in the U.S portfolios. Hence, H2b is rejected for the U.S. However, the two most recent heat waves in particular caused more noticeable stock price effects (Table 2). This may be explained by a higher sensitization to climate issues in recent years. As expected, U.S. firms with low environmental performance were the most heavily penalized by investors (Fig 3). Due to the reported comparative outperformance of high-scoring firms in Fig 3, H3 is accepted for the U.S. sample. Upon examining the aggregated results, more statistically significant stock price reactions occurred for the U.S. than for the European portfolios (Fig 3). This finding suggests a greater salience of heat waves in the U.S. stock market compared to Europe. Moreover, the most statistically significant stock price reactions take place within the shortest EW of [−1, +1], centered around the peak day. This finding highlights the important role of the peak day of heat waves as this day typically attracts the most public attention. Furthermore, over the whole sample, there are fewer stock price reactions for firms with high environmental performance, while firms with low environmental performance experienced the most stock price reactions. Overall, most stock prices were negatively affected across the entire sample (Fig 3). This study contributes to research methodology by presenting a pioneering fusion of methodologies from meteorology and finance. This innovative approach breaks new ground by integrating primary meteorological data with event study methodology in the context of efficient stock markets [70]. This methodological synergy not only enhances the robustness of financial decision-making in the face of climate change but also sets a precedent for interdisciplinary research. By doing so, it opens up novel pathways to understanding the intricate interplay between global climate phenomena and investor behavior. Thus, this study addresses the research gap highlighted by Venturini [22], emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration with climate scientists to enhance the evaluation of climate risk threats to financial markets. Moreover, this study contributes to climate science by meteorologically identifying the five most extreme European and U.S. heat waves, respectively, since 1979. The results derived from the applied HWMId method are supported by previous studies. For example, the European heat waves in 2010 and 2014 (Fig 2a) were also identified as among the strongest European heat waves in previous research. In particular, the 2010 heat wave was confirmed as the strongest on record over the European continent [57], and the European heat waves in 2018 and 2021 were also identified as major heat events by Lhotka and Kysely [71]. Despite its short duration (Table 2), the 2021 heat wave over northwestern parts of the U.S. is well-documented and has received significant attention [72, 73]. The longer durations of heat events observed in Europe compared to the U.S. are theoretically confirmed and explained by differences in atmospheric circulation patterns [74]. The alignment with previous research supports the application of the study’s grid-point method for continental analysis. Moreover, the result of an increasing frequency of heat waves as an imprint of global warming aligns with findings by the IPCC [6]. Through the meteorological analysis, this study addresses the research gap regarding the comparison of historical European and U.S. heat waves. This study offers valuable contributions to the climate finance literature and practical insights for investors, firm managers, and policymakers, illustrating how heightened physical climate risk can diminish firm values. The authors posed the research question: How do stock markets react to major European and U.S. heat waves, taking into account corporate environmental performance? The event study results show that the five major heat waves in each region over the past 45 years have impacted stock markets, underscoring the urgent need for investors and firm managers to consider physical climate risks in their financial strategies. The negative reactions may stem from behavioral overreactions to salient heat events [40] or from the prior underpricing of heat risk, leading to market corrections [21]. For policymakers, these findings emphasize that investors are aware of physical climate risks, as demonstrated by the statistically significant stock market responses to each heat event. These negative market reactions highlight the urgent need for policies aimed at mitigating these risks and addressing their broader economic impacts. Moreover, the authors questioned whether the observed increase in the frequency of heat waves over Europe and the U.S. within the past four decades has led to increased awareness of global warming in the stock market. In the U.S., the stock market has been more responsive to recent heat waves, whereas in Europe, stock price reactions are influenced by their intensity and duration. Investors’ reactions to European heat waves possibly do not appear to have increased for more recent events because this region has already been a pioneer in environmental awareness for several years [75]. In contrast, the U.S. stock market’s growing attention to climate risks in recent years aligns with Schuster et al. [37] and their finding of a catch-up effect in the U.S. market compared to Europe. This aligned catch-up effect in climate risk recognition is further demonstrated by a generally higher frequency of statistically significant stock price reactions in the U.S. market. The assumption underlying the catch-up effect in climate risk recognition and pricing stems from historically higher levels of climate skepticism in the U.S. compared to Europe, followed by a gradual increase in sensitization [37]. Consequently, this pattern may also extend to the valuation of green and brown stocks in response to heat events. U.S. portfolios associated with high environmental performance exhibited a reduced likelihood of facing value losses, thus suggesting a potential hedging opportunity for investors and firm managers. This result aligns with the findings by Li [76], implying that firms with higher environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings are better equipped to adapt to increased physical climate risk exposures. Furthermore, the U.S. stock market shows a normative character by punishing firms with low environmental scores, resulting in value losses for contributors to climate change. This market behavior provides a financial foundation for U.S. climate policies by demonstrating the stock market’s capacity to support a green transition. Moreover, the study’s results align with those of Choi et al. [41] that investors sell brown stocks during heat periods. The stock price reactions to U.S. heat waves also confirm the finding by Huynh and Xia [40] of less market penalization for U.S. firms with superior environmental performance in times of salient physical climate risks (Fig 3). The outperformance of high-scoring firms in periods of high salience to physical climate risks in the U.S. demonstrates alignment among different proxies for environmental performance: this study utilizes the environmental performance ratings provided by LSEG, whereas Huynh and Xia [40] employ metrics by MSCI. Nevertheless, it is important to note the recent criticism directed at ESG rating providers for their lack of consistency, as highlighted by Berg et al. [77]. Contrary to expectations, the results for the European sample show the most positive stock price reactions for firms with low environmental performance and the most negative for firms with high environmental performance. Accordingly, for European stocks, investors in brown stocks (firms with low environmental performance) demand higher returns as compensation for holding riskier assets. In contrast, green stocks (firms with high environmental performance) deliver lower returns compared to the market, reflecting investors’ acceptance of reduced returns for non-pecuniary reasons. These explanations are in line with Pástor et al. [49]. Chiappini et al. [78] also previously identified a positive stock price reaction among sustainable firms in response to exogenous market shocks in the U.S., in contrast to a negative effect in Europe. Furthermore, Kaiser [43] suggests that sustainability performance has not yet been fully reflected in the market value of U.S. firms compared to European firms. Consequently, in Europe, corporate environmental performance grades may already be priced into stock returns and are therefore not perceived as a ‘new benefit’. In contrast, the U.S. market may have shifted its focus to the previously underemphasized environmental performance levels of firms, recognizing higher performance as advantageous during heat waves. The novel insights from this study highlight four limitations and corresponding major avenues for future research. First, the findings of this study suggest that, unlike in the U.S. sample, environmental performance is not a suitable proxy for hedging European stocks against physical climate risks, specifically heat risk. Future studies should further examine investor expectations to understand why high environmental performance is not enough to hedge European firm values against heat waves. The dilution effect detected in European environmentally high-scoring portfolios should encourage future research to find a suitable proxy that firm managers and investors can rely on. A more rigorous measurement of corporate environmental responsibility is required to protect firm values in light of the advancing environmental regulations in Europe [79]. Second, this study relies solely on environmental performance grades by LSEG as single proxy for corporate environmental responsibility. By investigating and comparing different proxies for environmental performance as potential hedges against salient physical climate risks, future research could contribute to the discussion on the divergence or convergence of ESG ratings [77, 80]. Third, this study compares portfolios based on corporate environmental responsibility. While this provides insights into investor preferences concerning individual firm performance, conclusions regarding sector sensitivities cannot be derived. The authors recommend that future research investigate the effects of these particular heat waves on various industry portfolios, specifically considering industries with high exposure to heat risk [29, 81]. Fourth, this study exclusively focuses on two highly developed, industrialized regions with significant market capitalizations: the U.S. and Europe. The authors recommend that future studies adopting this study’s interdisciplinary method encompass a broader range of geographical regions to gain further meteorological and stock market insights, particularly in developing countries. Researchers may wish to investigate the Global South, particularly regions that are especially vulnerable to physical climate risks [82]. This study examined how the rising frequency of heat waves since 1979 has heightened stock market awareness of global warming. In Europe, stock price reactions are influenced by the intensity and duration of heat waves, whereas in the U.S., the market has shown greater responsiveness to recent heat waves, with superior corporate environmental performance mitigating heat risk. The study draws investors’, firm managers’, and policymakers’ attention to the fact that heat waves can significantly erode firm value.

We used data from the CDC WONDER database from 1999–2020 to identify trends in the IHD-related mortality of patients ≥ 75 years in the US. AAMRs per 100,000 population and APC were calculated and categorized by year, sex, race, and geographic divisions. Between 1999 and 2020, a total of 8,124,568 IHD-related deaths were recorded. Notable declines in AAMR were observed from 1999 to 2014 (APC: -3.86) and from 2014 to 2018 (APC: -2.55), with an overall increase from 2018 to 2020 (APC: 3.76). Older men consistently demonstrated higher AAMRs than older females, with AAMRs for both sexes decreasing steadily from 1999 to 2018 and increasing in 2020. When stratified by race/ethnicity, Whites (1931.7) had the highest AAMR, followed by Blacks (1836.5), American Indians (1510.5), Hispanics (1464.4), and Asians (1093.6). Furthermore, nonmetropolitan areas (2015.2) showed greater AAMRs than metropolitan areas (1841.8). The ≥ 85-year group consistently exhibited higher IHD-related mortality rates compared to the 75–84 years group. In comparison, the older group [≥75 years] (1873.0) consistently exhibited higher IHD-related AAMRs than the younger group [<75 years] (64.0) throughout the study, showing a significant disparity. Chronic IHD (1552.0) consistently showed the highest AAMRs throughout the study, surpassing myocardial infarction (515.6), other ischemic heart diseases (24.0), and angina pectoris (5.6). Targeted interventions and resource allocation are crucial for areas with high IHD-related mortality. Public health policies should address demographic and geographical disparities, with further research for effective strategies.

Ischemic heart diseases (IHD) are a group of cardiac conditions that are marked by insufficient blood flow to the myocardium due to an obstruction in coronary arteries, causing an imbalance between the demand and supply of myocardial oxygen [1]. The primary coronary risk factors comprise hypertension, age, metabolic syndromes, genetics, and smoking, among many other causes [2]. Due to a variety of common risk factors, IHD contributes significantly to the global burden of disease. As per the reports of World Health Organization (WHO), IHD accounted for 8.9 million deaths worldwide in 2019, representing about 16% of the total deaths globally [3]. Despite a reduction in its death rates over the years, the global burden of IHD has surged by 29% from 1990 to 2010, with the largest increase in mortality since 2000 [3, 4]. These alarming statistics are proof that IHD poses a significant threat to sustainable development in the 21st century by causing disastrous increases in US health expenditures. As such, costs associated with IHD healthcare are expected to soar by 41%, increasing from $126.2 billion in 2010 to 177.5 billion in 2040 [4]. Furthermore, heart failure, which is the most prevalent consequence of IHD, results in an estimated annual global cost of $108 billion [5]. Although the recent statistics are very ominous, it is important to acknowledge the fact that there has been substantial improvement in hospitalization and readmission rates from IHD in the US, owing to recent advances in technology and medical therapy [6]. Through this study, we aim to analyze the IHD-related mortality trends in the United States of America (USA) over 20 years with regard to demographical and geographical variations. The analysis will underscore the importance of targeted interventions and resource allocation to address areas with higher mortality rates and shed light on health inequities among the elderly. Additionally, our study will also be able to highlight the impact of policy decisions and public health interventions aimed at improving cardiovascular health outcomes. In essence, the study aims to contribute to understanding IHD-related mortality trends, providing a foundation for further studies and informing strategies to reduce mortality rates and improve public health outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. The analysis was based on the data sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database, which includes mortality causes from death certificates from 50 states and the District of Columbia in the United States [7]. The underlying cause of death (UCD) refers to the disease directly leading to the demise, while multiple cause of death (MCD) encompass other conditions associated with the fatal outcome. Both UCD and MCD are classified using the International Classification of Diseases (Tenth Edition).We analyzed Multiple Cause-of-Death (MCD) Public Use record death certificates to identify deaths related to ischemic heart diseases in individuals of age greater than 75 years. This study included all decedents with IHD (I20.0, I20.1, I20.8, I20.9, I21.0, I21.1, I21.2, I21.3, I21.4, I21.9, I22.0, I22.1, I22.8, I22.9, I24.1, I24.8, I24.9, I25.0, I25.1, I25.2, I25.3, I25.4, I25.5, I25.6, I25.8, I21.9) as MCD [8]. Therefore, this study included data from the death certificates that either identified IHD as the underlying cause of death or as one of the contributing causes of death. The study did not necessitate institutional review board (IRB) approval because it exclusively analyzed government-issued public use data, devoid of individually identifiable information. Furthermore, the study was conducted in adherence to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines [9]. The number of IHD-related deaths and population size were extracted from 1999 to 2020. The data on age, sex, race and ethnicity, region, state, and place of death was also obtained. The patients aged ≥75 years were selected and divided into 10-year age groups. For race, patients were stratified into Hispanics, Non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, NH Asian/Pacific Islander, and NH American Indian/Alaskan Native. Regions were categorized into Northeast, Midwest, South, and West, following the Census Bureau-defined regional divisions. The population was additionally classified into metropolitan, non-metropolitan, and rural counties in accordance with the National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme [10]. Crude mortality rates (CMRs) and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 population were calculated for IHD-related deaths. CMRs were derived by dividing the number of IHD-related deaths by the corresponding US population for that specific year. AAMRs were determined by standardizing the IHD-related deaths to the year 2000 US population [11]. Trends in both crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression Program (Version 4.9.0.0, National Cancer Institute), which models consecutive linear segments on a log scale connected by joinpoints, where the segments converge [12]. Joinpoint regression has been extensively applied across various domains to assess trends in time series data, such as cancer mortality[13]. A notable advantage of this method is its ability to identify points where significant changes in trends occur, allowing for a more detailed analysis of shifts within longitudinal data. The annual percent change (APC) with its 95% CI was also calculated. Slopes were considered increasing or decreasing if the estimated slope differed significantly from zero. The statistical significance was determined by 2-sided t-testing (p = 0.05). Between 1999 and 2020, a total of 8,124,568 IHD-related deaths were recorded among adults aged 75 years or older [S1 Table]. Information regarding the location of death was available for 7,803,875 of these deaths. Among these, 41% occurred in medical facilities, 30% in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, 26% at home, and 3% in hospices. [S2 Table] The AAMRs for IHD-related mortality in the elderly has gradually declined from 2718.1 in 1999 to 1521.5 in 2020. Additionally, a noticeable decrease in AAMR was seen from 1999 to 2014 (APC: -3.86; 95% CI: -5.2 to -1.8). Subsequently, the AAMRs showed a significant decline from 2014–2018 (APC: -2.55; 95% CI: -5.03 to -1.45), which was followed by an overall increment of AAMR from 2018 to 2020 (APC: 3.76; 95% CI: -0.3 to 6.45). [Fig 1, Table 1 and S3 Table]  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g001  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.t001 Throughout the study duration, older men consistently demonstrated higher age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) than older females, despite both groups showing a downward trend (overall AAMR Males: 2391.0 [95% CI: 2388.7–2393.4]; Females: 1547.6 [95% CI: 1546.1–1549.1]) [Table 1]. The AAMR for males decreased from 3371.0 in 1999 to 2051.2 in 2020, while the AAMR for females reduced from 2346.0 in 1999 to 1157.6 in 2020. The AAMRs for males between 1999 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend [APC: -3.51 (95% CI -4.9892, -1.5164)]. From 2012 to 2018, the AAMRs continued to decrease, albeit at a slower rate [APC: -2.61 (95% CI -4.0239, -1.3244)]. However, a subsequent increase in AAMRs was observed till 2020, [APC: 4.49 (95% CI 0.66, 6.81)]. [Fig 1, Table 1 and S4 Table] For females, a similar pattern was observed. The AAMRs decreased steadily from 1999 to 2018 [APC of -4.29 (95% CI -4.51, -4.12)], followed by a moderate increase till 2020 [APC: 4.68 (95% CI -0.0985, 7.0612)]. [Fig 1, Table 1 and S4 Table] When stratified by race/ethnicity, NH Whites had the highest AAMR, followed by NH Black, NH American Indians, Hispanics, and Asian or Pacific Islander (overall AAMR NH White: 1931.7 [95% CI: 1930.2–1933.1]; NH Black or African American: 1836.5 [95% CI: 1831.9–1841.2]; NH American Indian or Alaska Native: 1510.5 [95% CI: 1492.0–1529.1]; Hispanic or Latino: 1464.4 [95% CI: 1459.7–1469.1]; NH Asian or Pacific Islander: 1093.6 [95% CI: 1088.1–1099.1]) [Table 1]. Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic/Latino showed a gradual decline in mortality rate from 1999 till 2018 [APC: Asian or Pacific Islanders: -3.98* (95% CI -4.25, -3.72); Hispanic/Latino: -4.37* (95% CI -4.71, -4.05)], followed by a much sharper rise for till 2020 [APC: Asian or Pacific Islander: 7.38* (95% CI 2.37, 10.14); Hispanic/Latino: 12.52* (95% CI 6.06, 16.08)]. Conversely, NH Whites showed a slight decline from 1999–2012 [APC: -3.77* (95% CI -4.83, -3.01)], which was followed by another significant decline till 2018 [APC: -2.64* (95% CI -3.79, -1.41)]. Subsequently, a sharp rise for was seen in the AAMRs till 2020 [APC: 3.24 (95% CI -0.40, 5.41)]. American Indian/ Alaska Native remain an exception, showing a more gradual but continuous decline throughout the study period [APC: -2.59 (95% C.I: -3.01, -2.13)]. Significant variations in AAMR were observed for NH Black/African American, showing a steady rate from 1999 to 2002 (APC: -0.85; 95% C.I: -2.89, 3.58), followed by a sharper decline till 2011 [APC: -4.83 (95% C.I: -6.83, 4.41)], a more gradual decline till 2018 [APC: -3.66 (95% C.I: -5.47, -2.00)], and finally a sharp rise till 2020 [APC: 7.87 (95% C.I: 3.27, 10.53)] [Fig 2, Table 1 and S5 Table].  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g002 When stratifying the older adults into two ten-year age brackets, the ≥85 years age group consistently displayed higher IHD-related mortality rates compared to the 75–84 years age group. In patients aged ≥85 years, the mortality rates steadily fell from 1999 to 2017 [APC: -3.64* (95% CI: -3.87, -3.46)], followed by a minimal increase from 2017 to 2020 [APC: 1.95 (95% CI: -0.60, 6.19)]. Meanwhile, in the 75–84 years group, the mortality rates fell sharply between 1999 and 2012 [APC: -4.08* (95% CI: -5.00, -3.84)], then remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2018 [APC: -2.99* (95% CI: -3.96, -1.66)], before rising significantly from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 4.35* (95% CI: 1.05, 6.48)]. [Fig 3, Table 1 and S6 Table].  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g003 When comparing older adults (patients aged ≥75 years) to younger individuals (patients aged <75 years), it was evident that the older group invariably exhibited higher IHD-related AAMRs throughout the study period, with a notable disparity between the two groups (overall AAMR Age ≥75 years: 1873 [95% CI: 1871.1–1874.3]; Age <75 years: 64 [95% CI: 63.9–64]). For patients aged ≥75 years, there was a marked reduction in the AAMR from 1999 to 2014 [APC: -3.86* (95% CI: -5.19, -1.84)], followed by a more gradual decline from 2014 to 2018 [APC: -2.55* (95% CI: -5.03, -1.45)], and a subsequent rise from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 3.76 (95% CI: -0.36, 6.45)]. In contrast, the AAMR for those aged <75 years experienced a steeper decrease from 1999 to 2010 [APC: -3.91* (95% CI: -4.60, -3.51)], a less marked reduction from 2010 to 2018 [APC: -1.36 (95% CI: -2.30, -0.54)], and a noticeable uptick from 2018 and 2020 [APC: 5.55* (95% CI: 1.78, 7.47)]. [Fig 4, Table 1 and S7 Table].  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g004 Similarly, nonmetropolitan areas showed greater AAMRs for mortality due to IHD than metropolitan areas, with overall AAMRs of 2015.2 (95% CI: 2012–2018.4) and 1841.8 (95% CI 1840.4–1843.2), respectively [Table 1]. Furthermore, the AAMRs of nonmetropolitan areas significantly decreased from 1999 to 2018 [APC: -3.00 (95% CI -3.29 to -2.81)] while subsequently increasing from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 5.33 (95% CI -0.44, 7.73)]. Metropolitan areas demonstrated a substantial decline from 1999 to 2014 [APC: -4.02 (95% CI -5.25 to -2.14)]. This was followed by a period of another significant reduction until 2018 [APC: -2.64 (95% CI -4.88 to -1.55)]. AAMRs remained stable from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 3.77 (95% CI -0.21, 6.42)]. [Fig 5, Table 1 and S8 Table].  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g005 Among the four census regions, the Northeastern region consistently exhibited the highest AAMRs throughout the study duration, followed sequentially by the Midwestern, Southern, and Western regions (overall AAMR Northeast: 2079.9 [95% CI: 2076.9–2082.9]; Midwest: 1923.1 [95% CI: 1920.4–1925.8]; South: 1815.1 [95% CI: 1813–1817.3]; West: 1706 [95% CI: 1703.3–1708.7]). A similar trend of IHD-related AAMRs was observed across the four census regions, with a marked decline from 1999 to 2018, followed by a significant increase between 2018 and 2020. In the Northeastern region, the AAMR substantially decreased from 1999 to 2018 [APC: -3.86* (95% CI: -4.09, -3.70)], before experiencing a prominent rise from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 4.41 (95% CI: -0.59, 6.74)]. Meanwhile, the AAMR for the Midwest steeply reduced from 1999 to 2010 [APC: -3.68* (95% CI: -4.95, -3.38)], followed by a less dramatic reduction from 2010 to 2018 [APC: -2.88* (95% CI: -3.47, -1.74)], and subsequently, a drastic escalation from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 4.87* (95% CI: 1.55, 6.91)]. Similarly, the Southern and Western regions also demonstrated a downward trend of IHD-related AAMRs at a variable pace between 1999 and 2018, before displaying a pronounced increase from 2018 to 2020 [APC South: 4.91* (95% CI: 1.17, 6.97); West: 2.66 (95% CI: -0.23, 4.29)]. [Fig 6, Table 1 and S9 Table].  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g006 When examining the different causes of IHD, chronic ischemic heart disease consistently demonstrated the highest AAMRs throughout the study period, significantly outpacing myocardial infarction, other ischemic heart diseases, and angina pectoris (overall AAMR Chronic IHD: 1552 [95% CI: 1550.8–1553.2]; Myocardial Infarction: 515.6 [95% CI: 515–516.3]; Other IHD: 24 [95% CI: 23.9–24.2]; Angina Pectoris: 5.6 [95% CI: 5.6–5.7]). For chronic IHD, the AAMR steadily diminished from 1999 to 2014 [APC: -3.68* (95% CI: -4.82, -2.05)], continued to decrease at a slower pace between 2014 and 2018 [APC: -2.46* (95% CI: -4.26, -1.40)], and then experienced a notable surge from 2018 to 2020 [APC: 4.62* (95% CI: 1.00, 7.05)]. The AAMR for myocardial infarction showed a slight reduction from 1999 to 2002 [APC: -3.90* (95% CI: -5.11, -1.99)], followed by a steep drop from 2002 to 2009 [APC: -6.54* (95% CI: -7.79, -6.13)]. This decreasing trend continued from 2009 to 2018 [APC: -4.19* (95% CI: -5.01, -3.75)], before stabilizing between 2018 and 2020 [APC: -0.11 (95% CI: -3.12, 1.70)]. Other ischemic heart diseases displayed a unique trend, with a marked reduction in AAMR from 1999 to 2004 [APC: -4.15* (95% CI: -10.59, -1.46)], a significant rise from 2004 to 2007 [APC: 9.39* (95% CI: 2.94, 12.92)], and a relatively stable period from 2007 to 2020 [APC: -1.99* (95% CI: -2.85, -1.36)]. For angina pectoris, the AAMR drastically fell from 1999 to 2008 [APC: -13.82* (95% CI: -16.33, -11.57)], followed by a slower decline from 2008 to 2014 [APC: -4.26 (95% CI: -16.71, 0.15)]. Afterward, there was a sharp escalation from 2014 to 2017 [APC: 21.58 (95% CI: -5.09, 27.58)], and a more moderate rise from 2017 to 2020 [APC: 8.07 (95% CI: -3.21, 14.65)]. [Fig 7, Table 1 and S10 Table].  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.g007 Using the deidentified national death certificate data from the CDC Wonder database we have identified several key findings of interest. First, we observed an overall decline in mortality from IHD in older adults in the US over the past 20+ years. Although this finding was true for either sex, males showed consistently higher mortality rates compared to females. Second, NH White older adults showed the highest IHD-related AAMR followed by NH Blacks, whereas Asians or Pacific Islanders showed the lowest and least variant AAMR compared to all other racial groups. Third, significant geographical variations were also observed, with rural areas showing the highest mortality rates. These results could prove impactful for efficient public health policy structuring. IHD-related mortality has shown a gradual decline from 1999 onwards, with a recent rise seen from 2019 to 2020. This coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic period, where patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors showed a tendency towards worse outcomes and higher need for emergency cardiovascular care. Furthermore, data from the CDC dataset suggests that 20–35% of COIVD-19 associated mortality occurred in patients with pre-existing CVD and risk factors [14]. Studies suggest endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and active inflammation to be aggravating factors for CVD, similar to diseases like diabetes and hypertension [15]. However, it is imperative to understand that the pre-pandemic trend depicting a decline in IHD-related mortality may be masked by a recent surge in mortality rates owing to the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Our analysis indicated that both men and women demonstrated a steady decline in IHD-related mortality rates, with women showing a slightly sharper decrease than men. Previous studies highlight the prominent gender-based disparities in diagnostic assessment of patients with IHD, where women remain evidently underdiagnosed, prone to prehospital delays in symptom presentation, present with higher rates of debilitating comorbidities including diabetes, and a consequent delay in aggressive treatment [16–18]. Data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) suggested that delays in contact-to-reperfusion time resulted in higher rates of mortality in women compared to men [19]. Some studies indicate the dominance of male cardiologists in hospital settings to be a major contributing factor towards low patient satisfaction among female patients [20, 21]. While there remain several interconnected factors underlying the disparities, recent data hints at slight improvements in outcomes for female IHD patients. For instance, improved physician training based on uniform evidence-based protocols has improved long-term mortality rates in women receiving emergency ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treatment [22]. Despite extensive research into the biological, pathophysiological, sex, gender, and socioeconomic-related determinants of IHD progression and presentation among either gender, practical implementations of this evident knowledge remain insufficient [23, 24]. We observed that both the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas showed a steady decline in the burden of IHD-related mortality, with the rate of decline being slightly higher in metropolitan areas [25]. Furthermore, delays in the transportation of patients with STEMI from the point of contact with primary emergency services to balloon inflation in the nearest primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facility may contribute to the urban/rural disparities. A study found that patients from rural regions had to travel 30 km further than those from urban areas to their nearest primary PCI facilities, thus leading to system delays [26]. Pre-hospital diagnosis using an electrocardiogram (ECG) will enable the EMS to bypass non-invasive medical facilities and limit the time delays. However, IHD-related AAMR remains consistently higher in nonmetropolitan areas compared to metropolitan areas, a disparity congruent with those observed in heart failure patients [27, 28]. This trend could be attributed to the relative inadequacy of advanced healthcare facilities and dedicated cardiac health centers, worsened by the low number of primary healthcare physicians and specialist physicians, such as cardiologists. Moreover, the low socioeconomic status and educational level of the elderly could be a possible reason for disparities in outcomes [25]. Our results also demonstrate variations in IHD-related mortality among different racial and ethnic groups in older adults, however, these differences appear less prominent when compared to younger populations [8]. In 1999, Black and NH White showed the highest mortality rates and a similar decline in AAMR over the study period when compared to other racial groups in the US. Notably, unlike the younger patients, older adults show significantly lower differences in IHD-related mortality rates among the different racial groups. Race and ethnicity could be considered a social construct, where societal, financial, political, and geographical forces influence the disparities in CVD outcomes. Despite decades of advancements in equal provision of healthcare facilities to all racial groups in the US, Black adults continue to suffer inadequate management of chronic illness, CVD being the most prominent. The recent trend indicates minimal difference in AAMR between NH White and Black, suggesting that past a specific age, the differences in socioeconomic and phenotypic status may have negligible impact on mortality outcome. This descriptive study also underscores significant regional disparities in IHD-related mortality, with the Northeast recording the highest mortality rates, followed by the Midwest, South, and West, respectively. Multitudinous elements contribute to the regional variations in health outcomes, including the availability of top-tier healthcare services, socioeconomic conditions, lifestyle choices, and genetic predisposition of the locals [29]. Compared to the other census regions, the low incidence of IHD-related mortality in the West can largely be attributed to better access to high-quality healthcare facilities, particularly in states such as California and Washington, which ensure prompt and effective cardiovascular disease management. Socioeconomic determinants, including higher average income and education levels in the Western states, further contribute to better cardiovascular health outcomes [29]. Effective state policies in the Western region, particularly in states like California, Washington, Idaho, and Utah, have fostered healthy lifestyle choices, such as higher physical activity levels and reduced smoking rates[29–31]. These policies have led to a diminished prevalence of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and CKD, thereby enhancing overall cardiovascular health. In contrast, high population densities and relatively low socioeconomic status in the Southern and Northeastern regions have led to poor healthcare access and inimical lifestyle choices. Additionally, the findings reveal that older adults (age ≥75 years) exhibit substantially higher IHD-related mortality rates compared to younger cohorts, including middle-aged adults, young adults, teenagers, adolescents, and children. Within the older adult cohort, the patients aged ≥85 years had a greater burden of mortality due to IHD than the patients aged between 75 and 84. This pronounced mortality in the elderly could be correlated with the age-related physiological changes in the cardiovascular system, like arterial stiffness and diminished myocardial reserve, and increased prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and CKD, which make the elderly more susceptible to IHD complications [32, 33]. The presence of several concurrent health issues can obscure or alter the symptoms of IHD in older adults, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, treatment options for older adults are often constrained due to the heightened risk of post-surgical complications from invasive procedures, such as angioplasty or CABG, and increased concerns about the adverse effects and drug interactions of existing evidence-based treatments, including statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors [34, 35]. Consequently, more conservative management approaches, which might not be as effective against severe IHD, are frequently employed. Additionally, barriers to healthcare access, including mobility issues, financial constraints, and lack of medical insurance, result in delayed treatment and infrequent follow-up visits in older adults. Analyzing the different causes of ischemic heart disease reveals that chronic IHD imposes a significantly higher mortality burden among older adults compared to acute ischemic conditions, such as myocardial infarction or angina pectoris. This disparity could be attributed to the increased prevalence of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and CKD, and the physiological age-related decline in cardiac function, which exacerbate the cumulative effect of prolonged ischemic stress on the heart. Moreover, the acute ischemic stress seen in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris is often effectively managed with contemporary interventions and evidence-based therapies, but the treatment response in chronic ischemic stress is sub-optimal. Nevertheless, there remains a pressing need for more extensive research to further elucidate the reasons behind elevated mortality rates associated with chronic IHD in older adults. Based on our findings, it is important that necessary steps are taken to implement targeted public health initiatives to address IHD-related mortality, particularly in regions with high burdens. Initiatives, such as the Million Hearts program, could be expanded to rural and nonmetropolitan areas to focus on risk factor reduction, including hypertension and cholesterol management. The National Rural Health Initiative can play a pivotal role by improving access to advanced cardiovascular care, such as establishing telemedicine services and mobile clinics for early detection and management of IHD in underserved areas. Additionally, policies, such as the Healthy People 2030 framework, can guide state-level interventions to reduce disparities by focusing on equitable access to care, especially for racial and ethnic minorities who consistently face higher mortality rates. Enhancing the deployment of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers and incentivizing the placement of cardiovascular specialists in underserved regions through federal programs like the National Health Service Corps can address geographic disparities. These focused measures, aligned with existing initiatives, have the potential to reduce inequities and improve cardiovascular outcomes across the United States. There are several limitations that should be considered. First, it is possible that the physician may be unable to appropriately diagnose the disease during the patient’s lifetime, misdiagnose the patient, or incorrectly enter the ICD codes which may lead to underestimation or misclassification of IHD as a cause of death. Additionally, the use of ’garbage codes’ in the database poses a significant challenge, as these non-specific or inaccurate codes can compromise the validity of the data and obscure true mortality trends. Second, the data available may lack information about the social determinants of available healthcare, which may influence demographic variations pertaining to IHD-related mortality. Third, there is no data on the medical treatments and interventions. Last, the database fails to provide data relevant to clinical variables including vital signs, laboratory findings, genetic analysis, and echocardiographic data that may prove helpful in understanding the phenotypic variations in IHD patients. In conclusion, the analysis has concluded that there was a gradual decline in IHD-related mortality over the course of the study. Despite reduction in the AAMRs during the last 20 years and advancements in medical therapy and technology, IHD remains a significant cause of mortality worldwide, with substantial impacts on global health and healthcare expenditures. The findings highlight important demographic and geographical disparities in IHD-related mortality rates, underscoring the need for targeted interventions and resource allocation to address areas with higher mortality rates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s004 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s005 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s006 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s007 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s008 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s009 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s010 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318073.s011 (DOCX) For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\n        here.

        "content": "in Walt Disney World Credit: Disney Doctors have warned of surging flu and COVID-19 cases in Central Florida, with ongoing outbreaks reportedly causing “very violent” symptoms that have the potential to impact Walt Disney World Resort visitors. Five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walt Disney World Resort and other theme parks have dropped the majority of restrictions. The likes of social distancing and masks are a distant memory at most destinations, with capacity also (for the most part) returning to near-normal numbers. However, that doesn’t mean there isn’t still some level of risk. This flu season has been harsh nationwide, with 43 states seeing high or very high levels of flu, as per the CDC. In Central Florida, doctors have reported a concerning wave of infections of COVID-19, the flu, and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) cases, with a significant number of patients sent to urgent care or the ER as people struggle to shake off their symptoms. “It’s creating some very violent symptoms,” Dr. Michael Sparks of SparksMD Family Medicine told Fox 35 as cases rise in over 30 counties. “We’re having a lot of patients who are struggling to kind of shake it, if you will, and even some requiring emergency visits for pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections, as well.” Visits to Central Florida emergency departments have reportedly increased by 4% this January compared to usual. Earlier this month, warnings were issued that cases of norovirus—a highly contagious stomach bug—were also increasing. Numbers tend to surge during colder months when guests gather indoors. Notably, Florida is in the midst of a harsh cold snap, with some areas (Orlando not included) experiencing snowfall this week. Of course, thanks to the likes of Walt Disney World Resort, Universal Orlando Resort, and SeaWorld Orlando, Central Florida has a very tourist-dense population (as one Reddit user put it, it’s an “international buffet of germs”). That means some level of caution is advisable when visiting crowded attractions to minimize the risk of spreading or catching disease. Walt Disney World Resort guests have complained about the increased likelihood of falling sick during their vacations in recent months. As one Reddit user noted in late 2024, “Is it just me or is it literally impossible to not get sick here anymore?” They added, “Been here 4 times in the past couple of years now. And every single time… basically immediately… I get the worst illness you can imagine.” Doctors have advised receiving the flu shot. While this may not totally prevent illness – after all, there are hundreds of flu strains out there – it can still reduce the severity of symptoms and prevent hospitalization. It’s also advised that anybody currently experiencing flu symptoms stays home until fever-free for at least two days.

        "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhukarpai/2025/01/23/public-health-success-is-fragilethe-return-of-measles-is-proof/",
        "content": "28 August 2019, Lower Saxony, Hanover: A pediatrician vaccinates a one-year-old child in the thigh ... [+] with the Priorix vaccine (live virus vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella). The federal cabinet has passed a law for compulsory measles vaccination. From March 2020, parents must prove that their children have been vaccinated before being admitted to a nursery or school. The compulsory vaccination also applies to certain adults, Photo: Julian Stratenschulte/dpa (Photo by Julian Stratenschulte/picture alliance via Getty Images) When I was a medical resident in South India in the 1990s, I rarely saw kids with measles. And I did not see much of polio or diphtheria or whooping cough either. None of this was a matter of luck. It was because childhood vaccination coverage in that region of India was high, and vaccines were highly effective in preventing these deadly childhood killers. Sadly, globally, childhood vaccination coverage is dropping, in part due to the health system disruptions caused by Covid-19 pandemic, and also because of increase in vaccine hesitancy. About 22 million children missed their measles vaccination in 2023. As a consequence, measles cases surged worldwide, infecting 10.3 million people in 2023, a 20% increase from 2022. In his timely new book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children's Health,” Adam Ratner, MD, MPH, a professor of pediatrics and microbiology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, traces the history of measles, its impact on child health, the spectacular success of vaccination campaigns, and the emerging threats to this success story. Cover of the new book \"Booster Shots\" (2025) by Dr Adam Ratner Madhukar Pai: The timing of your book on measles could not be more relevant, with the inauguration of President Trump, and his choice of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation's biggest health agency. Several new books have documented the alarming rise of disinformation and anti-science. In this context, tell us a bit about the importance of your book and its biggest messages. Adam Ratner: We have come to a place where political polarization is having direct negative effects on children’s health. This was true before the most recent election, and it was true – though to a substantially lesser extent – even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic accelerated and accentuated our divisions, and people focused their anger and frustration on public health measures, including vaccines, and on the messengers. As a result, we are now faced with a much worse scenario, in which even routine vaccination is under threat. Vaccines represent one of humanity’s greatest achievements – they allow us to prevent death and suffering from a host of diseases that were major causes of childhood death not that long ago. The measles vaccine alone has saved more than 60 million lives – mostly children’s lives – over the past 25 years. The most important message of my book is that those sorts of achievements are not guaranteed. Public health successes can be fragile. Politics, education, trust in science – these things all matter, and with the fraying of trust that is unfolding in front of us, we risk losing that hard-won progress. Madhukar Pai: In your book, you explain how measles infects humans, how extraordinarily infectious the virus is, and the immune amnesia it causes. Because many parents today have not seen the deadly consequences of measles, they think it is a mild cold. Why do we need to take measles seriously? Adam Ratner: Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963, nearly everyone had measles at some point during childhood. It is, quite literally, the most contagious virus known, so there was really no escaping it. In high-income nations like the United States and Canada, most children and families experienced measles as an inconvenience – a week or so of fever and rash, followed by a complete recovery. Even in those countries, though, measles caused tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths every year. These numbers were low enough that most people could still think of measles as just another childhood illness, but every year there were families that were shattered as a result of measles. Measles infection also induces a kind of immune amnesia, literally erasing our immune system’s memory and increasing the odds of acquiring other serious infections for several years afterwards. As a result, measles vaccination provides two kinds of benefits – protection against the short-term risks of measles as well as prevention of the longer-term danger of measles-induced immune amnesia. Because measles is so contagious, we get the best protection when a very high proportion of the population (more than 95%) is vaccinated. Because very young children and some immunocompromised people can’t get the measles vaccine, it is even more important for all of the rest of us to get vaccinated. Madhukar Pai: In your book, you write, ‘measles preys on the weak, the crowded, the malnourished.’ Can you please explain the relevance of this and how it also translates into information that can be used to limit the damage measles can cause? Adam Ratner: Across the world and across centuries, the burden of measles falls on those with the least resources. In the absence of vaccination or prior infection, all humans are susceptible to measles infection, but the outcome of that infection can depend on a much wider range of socioeconomic factors. One of the best examples is nutrition. We know that children with vitamin A deficiency are at substantially higher risk of death from measles than those who are not deficient. Providing vitamin A supplementation and, on a larger scale, ensuring adequate nutrition overall, decreases the risk of death from measles and many other infections. Likewise, overcrowded living conditions lead to children having increased exposure to measles at an earlier age – another factor that increases the risk of severe or fatal infection. Preventing measles through vaccination is the most important way to limit its toll, but understanding which kids are at highest risk and how we might be able to mitigate the impact of a host of infections beyond measles by targeting social and economic inequities is empowering in a different way. Madhukar Pai: By 2000 the US had successfully eliminated measles. So what happened after 2000? Why are there so many measles cases and outbreaks today? What went wrong? Adam Ratner: Thanks to expanded measles vaccine coverage, we were able to eliminate measles from the US in 2000. Some of the reasons that we are still dealing with measles today are (1) elimination is not the same as eradication. Elimination of a disease from a specific area at a specific time is a huge accomplishment, but it is a state that requires constant vigilance and maintenance of high vaccination levels. Travel-associated cases can still occur, and if vaccination levels drop, elimination is threatened. (2) There was an underestimation of the growing threat of the anti-vaccine movement. This threat has grown significantly, and we have seen alarming decreases in childhood vaccination rates, particularly in recent years. Madhukar Pai: The Covid-19 pandemic has dented public confidence in vaccines, in public health, and in science itself. As a pediatrician and vaccine expert, how do you tackle vaccine hesitancy among parents? Adam Ratner: There is no easy answer to this question, and addressing vaccine hesitancy or frank anti-vaccine attitudes has to happen at multiple levels – from individual families, to local communities, to regional or national policy. Pediatricians remain trusted advisors for parents, and as I discuss in the book, it is important for us to have these discussions carefully, with empathy, but clearly. It is crucial to make sure that parents have the information that they need and a strong and well-explained recommendation from their child’s pediatrician. At the level of communities and even governments, we need calm, science-based voices to explain the role of vaccination in keeping kids healthy and to counteract the continuous onslaught of misinformation and even disinformation that comes from an increasingly sophisticated and well-funded anti-vaccine movement. Dr Adam Ratner, author of \"Booster Shots\". Dr Ratner is a Professor of Pediatrics and Microbiology ... [+] at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital and Bellevue Hospital Center. Madhukar Pai: Globally, childhood vaccination coverage rates have dropped during the Covid-19 pandemic, and there is resurgence of whooping cough and polio as well. This is a massive challenge for global health. What lessons can we learn from measles, that we can apply to this problem? Adam Ratner: The erosion of vaccine confidence has both short- and long-term impacts, neither of them good for children. In the short term, delaying or declining vaccines for individual kids puts them at risk for serious infections. We are already seeing increasing numbers of vaccine-preventable diseases. Because it is so contagious, measles clusters are often a bellwether for falling vaccine rates and loss of trust in public health systems. Pertussis (whooping cough) is another important vaccine-preventable disease, and we should also remember that we have vaccines to reduce the risk of influenza and COVID-19. Both of those vaccines provide considerable protection against hospitalization and death. Last year we had more than 200 deaths from influenza in children in the US, yet less than half of eligible kids get vaccinated. Bringing attention to these issues and trying to stem the erosion of public health systems are going to be crucial goals in the coming years – if vaccination rates continue to fall, we will see more frequent, more sustained outbreaks of preventable diseases. Madhukar Pai: In your book, you talk about how measles thrives when we forget. And you recommend that we need ‘booster shots’ (title of your book) to bring back the memory. Please explain this for us. Adam Ratner: Vaccines are medical marvels – they can protect children and adults from serious diseases – but the absence of disease doesn’t look like much. It just looks like regular life. You never get to know which kids were protected from meningitis or pneumonia or whooping cough. Vaccines are masters at making nothing happen. The problem is that, as we have seen with measles and polio, as time passes, generations of parents (and even doctors) come along who have never seen or even heard of these diseases, and people begin to question why pediatricians are advocating that they vaccinate against infections that are rare. The answer, of course, is that the diseases are rare because of vaccination and that if we stop vaccinating, in many cases, these diseases will return. This is a sort of “societal amnesia” that is analogous to the way that measles infection can specifically target the memory cells of a person’s immune system, causing them to become susceptible to diseases that they have encountered in the past – a situation called “immune amnesia”. Just like a booster shot of a vaccine can remind your immune system how to fight off a microbe when your immunity is waning, we need to communicate about our past public health successes, recognize and own up to when we have fallen short, and engage with parents, community leaders, and policymakers. We need to make sure that we don’t lose our collective understanding of how important vaccination and other aspects of public health are for children. If we don’t succeed at this, the consequences for kids may be dire.  One Community.

DOJ had him arrested again on a gun charge” [Politico]. “A Jan. 6 defendant whose felony assault charges were dismissed a day earlier was arrested Wednesday on federal gun charges that have been pending for nearly two years in Florida…. But Ball’s charges for being a felon in possession of a firearm remained pending and unconnected to his Jan. 6 case. According to that indictment, Ball has previously been convicted of domestic violence battery by strangulation in June 2017, resisting law enforcement with violence and battery of a law enforcement officer in October 2021. It’s unclear if U.S. marshals executed the arrest warrant on Ball prior to his release on the Jan. 6 charges. However, it’s the first docketed federal criminal case in Washington since Trump’s inauguration.” • Amusing!    Biden Administration “Joe Biden Clearly Thinks Donald Trump Isn’t Bluffing” [Slate]. “Biden issued a second round of preemptive pardons, as stunning as the first. They were granted to five members of his immediate family. The recipients are his brothers and sister, James Biden, Frank Biden, and Valerie Biden Owens, and their spouses, John Owens and Sara Biden. None of them is well known to the public. None has been a prominent critic of Trump. That he would feel the need to protect them tells us how deeply fearful Biden is about the lengths to which Trump will go to punish any member of what Trump and his allies label the ‘Biden Crime Family’.” • Or they were all wetting their beaks.   Trump Administration This just in: “Trump wants nuclear reduction talks with China, Russia” [The Hill]. “President Trump while addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday said that he wants to hold talks with Russia and China about reducing nuclear weapon stockpiles. Trump during his first term failed to bring China into negotiations to extend a nuclear arms treaty with Russia, called New START, which places key limits on deployed nuclear weapons and expires February 2026. U.S. and Russian participation in the treaty effectively froze during the Biden administration, as Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to impose costs on Washington for supporting Ukraine militarily. Putin has also threatened the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine to try to deter U.S. and European military support for Kyiv. Addressing the global forum, Trump recounted talks with Putin ahead of the 2020 U.S. election about denuclearization talks and how ‘China would have come along.’ ‘We want to see if we can denuclearize, and I think that’s very possible,’ Trump said. ‘And I can tell you that President Putin wanted to do it, he and I wanted to do it. We had a good conversation with China, they would have been involved, and that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet.'” • Good, but now do climate. * * * “Trump wants nuclear reduction talks with China, Russia :  “President Trump, Crypto Billionaire” [Wall Street Journal]. “Donald Trump doesn’t always separate his personal interests from his public obligations, and a howling example is his sudden new status as a crypto billionaire. The President is inviting trouble with what looks like remarkably poor judgment. Crypto markets have boomed since Mr. Trump’s election in part on expectations of friendlier regulation. And so be it. Animal spirits have been rising all around. But Mr. Trump and his family have tried to cash in on the mania by minting Trump-branded coins…. Unlike Trump-stamped tumblers ($42) and pickleball paddles ($180), crypto tokens are vehicles for speculation. Like other cryptocurrencies, their price is volatile. After surging roughly 10-fold after its launch, $TRUMP’s price has since fallen by half…. All of this creates flashing-red political risks and ethical conflicts. Start with who may be buying the tokens. A business or foreign official with interests before the federal government might seek to curry favor with Mr. Trump by announcing plans to buy millions of his token to pump up the price. Or, worse, whispering to Mr. Trump that he’s made the purchases, since crypto holdings aren’t disclosed. If Mr. Trump’s regulators then act in a way that aids crypto or the person seeking the favor, he’ll be accused of aiding the buyer in service of presidential self-dealing. The President might claim immunity by saying the regulation is part of his official duties, but that won’t remove the political taint. That also won’t stop civil lawsuits if (and probably when) there’s a crypto crash. A President isn’t immune from lawsuits for actions taken before becoming President under the Supreme Court’s Clinton v. Jones (1997) ruling. Mr. Trump has created a regulatory nightmare for Paul Atkins, his highly qualified nominee to run the SEC. Mr. Atkins was crypto-friendly long before his nomination, but now any regulatory move he takes that the industry supports will be attacked as helping Mr. Trump’s business. If the token’s price drops, buyers who lose money could argue that Mr. Trump failed to make required securities disclosures about the risks. Democratic state Attorneys General could seek restitution for investors.” And importantly: “No careful President would get anywhere near this kind of political risk, and we can’t recall any President who has. Where are Mr. Trump’s lawyers? … The crypto caper is a worrisome sign that Mr. Trump’s current advisers don’t understand the difference any better than he does, or that they are too cowed to speak up.”• Again I ask whether Susie Wiles knew about this, or whether the first she heard was what she read in the papers. * * * “Trump hires fed-firing mastermind” [Politico]. “President-elect Donald Trump is bringing back a senior White House official who led his first-term push to make it easier to fire civil servants. James Sherk, who served as a special assistant on domestic policy during Trump’s first term, will return to serve in the White House Domestic Policy Council, Trump announced Saturday. Sherk has worked at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute during the Biden administration. Sherk was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to fire some federal employees using a classification called Schedule F. That effort generated an outcry from civil servants, and the Biden administration moved quickly to reverse course. The incoming Trump administration has made it clear that it plans to pursue drastic reforms to the federal workforce, and Sherk is poised to be central to those efforts. Trump has vowed to “shatter the deep state” and make it easier to fire ‘rogue bureaucrats.'” The dude wouldn’t know a Communist if [insert joke here]:  Everything Donald Trump is dismantling will be parked at a bunch of communist 501c3’s until the next Democrat President, when it will be quickly restored to government. The Trump admin MUST go after the left wing non profits to secure long term victories. Break them. Strike. — Oilfield Rando (@Oilfield_Rando) January 22, 2025   Nevertheless, institutionally he’s quite right; that’s what the NGOs will do. * * * “Gabbard’s nomination on shaky ground” [Semafor]. “Tulsi Gabbard’s bid to become Donald Trump’s director of national intelligence is on shaky ground, with Republican lawmakers raising private concerns and the president urging her to get aggressive. Republicans are particularly hesitant about her past statements that some have read as too warm toward Vladimir Putin and former Syrian regime leader Bashar al-Assad, whom Gabbard met with in 2017. She’s also questioned some intelligence-gathering tools, though she recently endorsed a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allows warrantless surveillance of foreign targets and has the power to sweep up domestic US communications.” • Gabbard shifted position on Section 702 to appease national security goons, and then a Federal District Court struck it down, as we saw yesterday. If Gabbard gives these people the vapors, she’s the right person for the job. “Senate panel sets hearing on Tulsi Gabbard nomination” [The Hill]. “The Senate Intelligence Committee has scheduled a hearing to review the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence. The Jan. 30 hearing comes after Democrats resisted the scheduling of an earlier hearing, saying they still didn’t have the full slate of background checks, ethics disclosures and paperwork on a candidate whose overall qualifications have sparked their concern. She has also been seeking to explain her past support of Snowden, saying she didn’t feel the intelligence community had sufficient channels for raising concerns. That explanation has not rested well with all Intelligence Committee lawmakers, however, who have called the National Security Agency leaker a traitor.” • Would have been helpful if Trump pardoned Snowden immediately. That would put the cat among the pigeons. (Of course, the real reason Gabbard is a “traitor” in these people’s minds is that she left the Democrat Party.) * * * Energy in the executive: “Doocy: Biden Staff Would Be In Such A Hurry To Get Us Out, ‘Trump Seemed Willing To Talk About Anything'” [RealClearPolitics] “Anytime that we would go into the Oval Office, for example, like I was for almost an hour last night with President Biden, the staff would be in such a hurry to get us out. And President Biden would just smile, and there were people yelling [(!!)]. They didn’t want him off script. They wanted him telling us whatever was on a note card that they had printed for him. Whereas last night, President Trump seemed willing to talk about anything. You could have asked him stuff from the news page, the gossip page, the sports page. He wants to put his fingerprints on everything, and his staff seemed like they were happy just to sit back and let it happen?” • People yelling?! Like “No Joe! Don’t go there!”? “Trump warns he’ll adjourn Congress to make recess appointments. How would that work?” [CBS]. “President Trump is threatening to use his powers to adjourn Congress so he can make recess appointments for at least some of his top Cabinet nominees and their deputies, enabling them to begin running the largest federal departments. Mr. Trump most recently raised the prospect of plunging the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory during his White House meeting Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, mulling the option if Democrats opt to slow-walk or delay his top national security and public health nominees, according to two people familiar with the meetings. ‘This remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,’ one of the people familiar with the meetings said, emphasizing this is not expected to happen this week, but remains under active consideration.” Article II, Section 3: “And in Case of Disagreement between [both Houses], with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.” Amusingly, since the Republicans control both Houses, it would be easy for Johnson and Thune to engineer a disagreement! But: “It is unclear how long Mr. Trump would recess Congress, given that a possible government shutdown looms in mid-March and Republican leaders have set an April goal of passing massive economic, tax and immigration legislation that would authorize Mr. Trump’s plans to cut inflation and taxes and dramatically overhaul border security policy.” • Trump would adjourn Congress for as it took to make the recess appointments. They would then reconvene. Of course, this would “make a mockery,” etc. etc. but here we are! “Trump’s Rush List for Security Clearances Poses Risks, and Congress Will Have No Oversight” [NOTUS]. “In an unprecedented move experts say could present a major national security risk, Donald Trump is handing out temporary top secret security clearances to White House staff without any of the usual background checks. ‘It seems unnecessary given that interim clearances can go through the normal procedure and be done in just a few days,’ especially with a White House request for expedited processing, the president of the Federal Clearance Assistance Service, William Henderson, told NOTUS. ‘If you’re the clearance authority and somebody gives you a name and says, ‘Give this person a clearance,’ you don’t know if his brother is working for the Mossad. You don’t know anything about it,’ Henderson added. Republican Senators either ceded trust to President Trump or deflected questions about security concerns — ranging from Sen. Rick Scott’s, ‘I believe the president’s going to do the right thing to keep our country safe,’ to Sen. Thom Tillis’ ‘I haven’t looked at it, I think due diligence is pretty important.’ Democrats pointed to a more nefarious reason than pure convenience: Trump could be slipping people into top positions that wouldn’t otherwise pass security muster.” • Russians, no doubt. “The Memo: Trump 2.0 comes into focus” [The Hill]. “Trump has been delivering on the “shock and awe” approach that his allies promised…. Beyond the pardons, the new president’s first days back at the White House have offered a bracing reminder of the chaotic showmanship in which he revels…. In total, Trump’s actions have elicited a mix of shock and familiarity among the president’s fans and foes alike… The bottom line is that the opposition party is bracing for four more years like the past three days. For Democrats, it’s a bleak prospect.” • One thing I don’t understand is that word “chaos,” often used by Democrats as the ultimate indictment of Trump’s style of governance. What’s more “chaotic” than a genocide and a proxy war with a nuclear power? “Trump’s blizzard of orders gets pushback, questions from GOP lawmakers” [The Hill]. “President Trump’s blizzard of executive orders during the first few days of his presidency has sent Republican lawmakers scrambling to make sense of what impact they’ll have on the country, and some GOP senators are already raising questions and concerns. Republicans were surprised by Trump’s order to immediately pause the disbursement of funds under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which they fear would stop funding to key projects in their home states. ‘Some of it is not helpful,’ said a senior Republican aide who noted Trump’s team would have been wise to provide more detail about the scope of the orders or could have waited until some of his nominees cleared Senate committees before taking actions that were likely to prompt legislative pushback.” • Hmm. * * * “RFK Jr. plans to keep a financial stake in lawsuits against the drugmaker Merck” [NPR]. “Even if Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as the next Health and Human Services secretary, he still plans to collect fees from Wisner Baum, a law firm suing Merck over claims that the pharmaceutical company failed to properly warn consumers about risks from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, according to new filings with the Office of Government Ethics. Kennedy will only collect the fees if Wisner Baum wins, and only for cases that aren’t against the United States or in which the United States isn’t a party and doesn’t have ‘a direct or substantial interest,’ according to the filings. ‘Pursuant to the referral agreement, I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,’ Kennedy wrote in his signed ethics agreement. ‘I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary.'”  DOGE “Maybe We Do Need DOGE” (interview) [Jennifer Pahlka, The Atlantic]. Interesting example of the hiring process, but too long to quote. Search on “we say we’re going to hire on the basis of merit.” Worth a read.       Our Famously Free Press “Three Disturbing Signs of Fourth Estate Failure” [Bill Scher, Washington Monthly]. The first: “David Marchese, co-host of The New York Times’s podcast The Interview, conducted a friendly chat with a pro-dictatorship political theorist, Curtis Yarvin, whom Vice President J.D. Vance once cited to argue in favor of a purge of civil servants. Marchese asked, ‘Why is democracy so bad, and why would having a dictator solve the problem?’ Yarvin replied by arguing Franklin D. Roosevelt operated as a dictator: ‘Just read the last 10 paragraphs of F.D.R.’s first inaugural address, in which he essentially says: ‘Hey, Congress, give me absolute power, or I’ll take it anyway.’ So did F.D.R. actually take that level of power? Yeah, he did.’ The problem with Yarvin’s response is that Roosevelt, upon becoming president in the depths of the Great Depression, did not ‘essentially’ take power against the will of Congress or threaten as much. He merely raised the possibility of asking Congress to give him emergency powers if the legislative process ran aground. • Scher then cites to the speech, and is correct (although my recollection is that Yarbin is not “pro-dictatorship” but monarchist (!!), which is supported by Wikipedia). Pretty amazing to watch the Times allow the chief spokeshole of the “neo-reactionary movement” throw FDR under the bus!    Democrats en déshabillé “Progressives focus their ire on US ‘oligarchy'” [The Hill]. “Progressives are focusing their messaging on being anti-oligarchy, training their sights not just on Republicans but also on Democrats they argue are too beholden to corporate interests…. But they aren’t just looking at Trump. Liberals are also forcing a conversation about their own party’s money-in-politics problem, hoping to redirect the focus ahead of the midterms. Justice Democrats is now recruiting dozens of new candidates, while Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) former 2020 campaign manager is now running to chair the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, strategists are working to protect members of the Squad from defeats. ‘November’s election is a mandate for the Democratic Party to clean up shop,’ said Usamah Andrabi, communications director of Justice Democrats, the most prominent group in charge of nurturing new progressive candidates for the House and Senate…. For many on the left, the re-brand is long overdue. For nearly a decade, ever since Sanders angered establishment figures in Hillary Clinton’s inner circle with a primary bid, moderate Democrats have relied on similar corporate influences as Republicans to various degrees. Many operatives still haven’t fully denounced corporate money funding elections, with many watching the donor-first approach work effectively for the GOP. Trump’s recent success has amplified that. By surrounding himself with the top 1 percent of the 1 percent, progressives say the president has created a prime backdrop for Democrats to create a contrast on campaign finance, their agreed-upon top issue for their party this year.” • “Their agreed-upon top issue.” Oh, is that it?   Realignment and Legitimacy Those who made Sanders impossible made Trump inevitable:  wild to be on the front page of Reddit pic.twitter.com/gWSqXsBO4x — David Sirota (@davidsirota) January 23, 2025   “The Second Trump Presidency, Brought to You by YouTubers” [Bloomberg]. “As Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th US President on Monday, he was surrounded by his family, donors and wealthy tech executives. Just a few feet farther away stood a political newcomer who’s been credited with encouraging lots of votes: Joe Rogan. The fact that Rogan, the host of the world’s most popular podcast, watched from the Capitol Rotunda as Republican luminaries like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis were confined to overflow speaks volumes about the new dynamics at play in Washington and the media writ large. Over the past two years, a set of massively popular podcasters and streamers cemented themselves as the new mainstream source of information for millions of young men, and, according to a new Bloomberg analysis, used their perch to rally these constituents in support of Trump and the political right.” Handy guest chart:  And: “Yet even as the podcasts have tried to brand themselves uniquely, similar themes and characters appear across the network. Bloomberg’s analysis of 2,002 episodes across the shows reveals how closely interconnected the podcasters’ relationships are, and how much the shows’ talking points overlap. Over the past two years, 152 guests made an appearance on at least two of the shows. Recurring characters are common, not just as guests, but as “friends of the shows,” including the UFC CEO White and comedian Shane Gillis. The effect gives viewers a sense of being inducted into a virtual, close-knit friend group from home.” • So, if I have this right, politics were being practiced?

Class Warfare “Trump’s Immigration Threats Are Already Wrecking the Food Industry” [The New Republic]. “Bakersfield, California, saw a massive drop off in the number of field workers showing up for work last week after Border Patrol agents in unmarked Chevy Suburbans rounded up and detained immigrants in the area, profiling individuals they believed to be field workers, reported CalMatters. The end result: acres of unpicked oranges roasting in the California sun at the height of the season. Bakersfield makes up a small portion of California’s Central Valley, which produces approximately a quarter of the nation’s food. Kern County, where Bakersfield is located, has ranked within the top three agricultural counties in the nation for the last several years, largely off the backs of undocumented laborers, who are estimated to comprise more than half of the county’s workforce, according to CalMatters. Losing the bulk of America’s agricultural workforce overnight is a recipe for ‘absolute economic devastation,’ according to Richard S. Gearhart, an associate professor of economics at Cal State-Bakersfield, who spoke with the nonprofit news outlet. ‘You are talking about a recession-level event if this is the new long-term norm,’ Gearhart said, arguing that the end result of Trump’s policies will be felt in the grocery store check-out lines across America.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\r\n\r\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Re Gabbard–it’s Trump who needs to get tough with his fellow Republicans. Obviously no Democrat will vote for Tulsi after Herself declared Gabbard the new lady Hitler. If Trump isn’t going to defend her he shouldn’t have nominated her. And if she gets shoved aside for no good reason it will be Swamp 1, Trump 0 and a bad sign indeed. “Obviously no Democrat will vote for Tulsi after Herself declared Gabbard…” Sorry, I do not understand this phrase.  Who is “Herself?”  Was there such a “declaration?”  Was this comment satire or sarcasm? Hillary of “I’m With HER” infamy And of social media control infamy. / ;) “Herself” = Hillary – I assume. Carolinian is absolutely right that Gabbard is gone unless Trump makes some major noise. There is *bipartisan* hatred of Gabbard for daring to speak some truths about Syria and Russia. And of course the Dems hate her for speaking truth about Hillary and the DNC and eventually giving up on the Party itself. That miserable warmongering ideologues like Rubio and Stefanik can sail through confirmation with no real problems from Democrats while Gabbard is demonized just indicates the absolute bipartisan domination of Congress by the War Party.  Most of what Trump has said and done so far is depressing as hell. Leaving Gabbard to the sharks would end the last shred of any lingering hope that anything whatsoever will change for the better. That Politico Pro article on the Section 702 strike down did give me a laugh, however, by referring to it as “a major win for privacy hawks.” Privacy “hawks”! Interesting phrasing. I wonder who the “privacy doves” are. Gabbard didn’t choose to give up on the DemParty.    The Pelosi Clintobamacrats actively drove her out of their party.    If Trump cares enough to instruct his base to give every Republican officeholder primary threats or death threats or whatever is required to terrorise them into unanimous support for Gabbard’s nomination, we’ll know he cares.    If he doesn’t ( give his base those instructions), we’ll know he doesn’t ( care). This is the one I remember, but not sure if it’s the same one Carolinian is talking about. From CNN; Hillary Clinton suggests Russians are ‘grooming’ Tulsi Gabbard for third-party run  Sorry. Thought that was common parlance around here. I believe Hillary said Tulsi was practically the same as Putin and Hillary has called Putin Hitler therefore….. She displayed good sense in turning her back on the democrat party. True, it does look like she abandoned a sinking ship, but is it not good sense to take to the life boat while there is time?  I know of nothing she has said or done that does other than make her eminently qualified. She is guilty of disagreeing with the revealed truth, the so-called narrative. Good for her.

Told the objective truth about several political items counter to the Party Narrative. True, but don’t forget Tulsi’s most-excellent knockout punch to Kamala in the 2020 primaries.  It was a joy (!) to watch! Oh it was indeed! That, if anything was Gabbard’s “Declaration of Independence” moment.\nTrump needs to step up and be seen to be supporting her. Gabbard is at least Vice Presidential material. Showed how election-losing Kamalabama Harris was during a debate, among other things. Publicly ripped Hillary right back when Hillary ripped her, for one thing. St. Nancy, I believe. I will be curious how Bernie and Fetterman vote on Tulsi. I do not believe either of them is a sure NO vote in this case. Bernie for historical loyalty she showed him and Fetterman because he’s already proven himself to be an iconoclast within the party. However, there may be some Rs who vote against her. Hopefully it will get to a floor vote. Yes. Johnson should force a voice vote at the least. Get the votes on the record.\nIf Trump doesn’t stand behind her, Kennedy Jr. and Patel, even if he loses, he is toast.\nIn Washington, if you don’t fight for something, you don’t get it. Trump’s Rush List for Security Clearances Poses Risks, and Congress Will Have No Oversight This is funny, given the entire US telecommunications network was hacked by the Chinese, or ostensible Chinese agents, because of the neoliberal fetish on privatization of all essential government functions, concomitantly with financial capitalism’s rampant destruction of functional companies in private equality rollups, including those in the IT security space, so they can collect sweet sweet government contracts at premium prices, while delivering insecure garbage. Ha. Not a serious country. > This is funny, given the entire US telecommunications network was hacked by the Chinese I hadn’t thought of that! “Security? What security?” Didn’t a small country the size of New Jersey but with less taste and manners run a lot of the telecommunications functions in the US? Anytime I see security news pointing at China I think of three fingers pointing back at a small country.  And due to Soviet emigration they may have a lot of Cyrillic keyboards too. I learned a couple of things today. I you use Twitter, you are a Nazi. Musk is a Nazi and if you use Twitter, that makes you a Nazi. There is no debate on this. Same goes for the Biden Crime family. They did nothing, NOTHING, wrong. There is no evidence anywhere they did anything wrong – none – zip – nada – zilch. If you think there is, you might be a Nazi (or a Russian). The unhinged masses outrage meter is banging off 10. It’s only leaking a little oil and making a few funny noises at this time. A wee bit of smoke and it’s shaking and wobbling – but still going strong. Some are even quite happy, and even bragging about how they are making the Trumpers in their family miserable. It’s going to be a long 4 years. Twitter can be great for a 10 second moment.  Allegedly:) Ten Second News, Son Volt Musk is not a Nazi. He is definitely a fascist. Did you learn to differentiate a Nazi salute and not-a-Nazi salute? It seems that there is still a lot of debate on that. I think this is what you seek!\nhttps://x.com/ssolyom/status/1881445983768498427?t=hCI9zGOheaI6Nnx9UBDIgA&s=19 With regard to the Biden family pardons –  Why date them all the way back to 2014?  Why date Fauci back to 2014?  The J6 Committee?  – what is going on with that?  What happened in 2014 and onward? The very fact these pre-emptive pardons were issued is all I need to know to confirm in my mind the extreme corruption that has been going on.  I fear for what may come out.  I am ashamed of my Democratic Party and ashamed for the country. I must say until I read this book, I had not a clue how bad this actually was.   It is possibly the most corrupt, lawbreaking family/individual to ever sit in the Oval Office. Trying to remember what happened in 2014.  The Maidan coup in Ukraine that year?  Financial stuff and biolabs in Ukraine.  The O admin halted  gain-of-function research funding.  (Except there seemed to be cutouts and workarounds that continued the research funding quietly.)   I don’t know why pardons backdated to 2014.  These are just a couple of guesses. I’ve been suspicious that Biden has a big rice bowl in unsavory bio-development in Ukraine for a stretch now. I seem to remember, not long after the start of the Russian SMO, Putin saying something about records collected at a Ukrainian bio-lab, and insinuating it merited consequences. Well, in 2014 that’s when the USA/CIA made our control over Ukraine official. Then Biden et al, moved in and started up the bio-engineering labs, dozens of them. I wonder who approved the grant for those labs> Monsieur le grand Fauci Extra incentives for the big guy, now reduced to lower case in diminished circumstances. Burisma and other low-hanging resources were just begging to be plucked. He was not salivating alone over the looting. Fauci should worry about the crimes against humanity cries that have been cropping up amongst many humans in various countries including, recently, Russia. 10-year statute of limitations. Bingo. The one good thing about these pre-emptive pardons is that legally these people can no longer plead the 5th when questioned. A pardon, by it’s very nature, assumes guilt and since you can no longer be charged you lose the ability to self-incriminate. The Republicans can (and should) get these people in front of Congress and make them spill all the tea. They can also be held in contempt for not talking or charged with perjury if they continue to lie. Yes, and I’m gonna love every second of it. Nothing to stop them from just saying, “I cant remember”. That’s both unfalsifiable and not self-incriminating I have forgotten where I heard it (quite possibly on Breaking Points) so I can’t give a link, but the American government’s funding for gain-of-function research in Wuhan started in 2014.  Then there are those medical research labs that were funded in Ukraine after the American takeover, which occurred during the same period of time.  Since Fauci’s personal baby seems to be gaining-of-function research, I would assume that it is this.  After all, he did lie under oath to Congress about it.  This would explain the length of the pardons. Coups, wars, blackmail, and other bad stuff courtesy of the Democratic Party (and aided by the Republicans if a war was involved.) er, that wasn’t beaks they were wetting… After Rogan, who is his own guy, a lot of those Podcasters got their start with and are still funded by right-wing dark money. Ben Shapiro, Dana White, etc.  Did J.D. Vance get some “bootstraps” from Focus on the Family? Seems like some support from that area was revealed when his book came out.  Most of this is the Tea Party all over again. “George R.R. Martin has co-authored a physics paper” #$@! Book tease at the top of the post? I think you knew exactly what some of your readers would hope that meant! I will however admit I dread having to get myself back up to speed to dive into the last book(s?) of Martin’s Game of Thrones series as much as I look forward to reading them and hopefully not as Brandon Sanderson’s best guess of what Martin meant to write if in fact he ever thought that far ahead or if this was a Strossian Merchant Dragon thing all along.  Apologies for the SF insiderism but it felt good to work three “I luvya but…” peeves into one paragraph. Blame Lambert as I’d mostly forgotten what I was waiting for until his cruel reminder : ( I saw a report of Martin saying he wasn’t going to finish the series, would rather spend time playing Elden Ring. Not sure if that was genuine, but years past the point where most people care. I believe it. I was really into the series some years ago, but to paraphrase Doc McCoy: “It’s dead Jim.” And the what I’ve heard about the silly ending to the TV show doesn’t make me any more interested if it were to actually materialize in book form. I wonder what percentage of people are in the same boat. I have no problem if he has actually abandoned the work, but would like a clear statement that he considers the TV shows ending as the canon end. It isn’t finished?   Someone bought me the thing in a six-book boxed set for birthday or Christmas a while back as they knew I loved ‘that kind of thing’ (ie Tolkien and Robert Jordan’s ‘Wheel of Time’).   I recall reading the first ten pages or so and then putting it down to pick up another time, maybe, if I had no other option.  ‘onest, guv.   But if it isn’t even finished there doesn’t seem any point embarking on the project at all. Maybe the dog will enjoy them as much as he did Stephen Donaldson’s ‘Chronicles of Thomas Covenant’, fortunately after I had finished those! My pregnant cat decided to give birth on the bottom shelf of my bookcase, on top of my Chronicles of Amber. In my fannish days I once wrote a paper entitled, “The Effective Use of the Dastardly Bastard as Protagonist: Selected notes, quotes and observations from the works of Roger Zelazny.  He was a lot of fun to read. “Jack of Shadows” is one of the best short novels ever : ) The physics Ph.D coauthor, Ian Tregillis, is also a very good alt history/ fantasy writer. His “Milkweed Triptych” trilogy is a memorable alt WW2 fantasy with warlocks, Lovecraftian cosmic demons, mutant SS commandos created by a mad scientist, and  great atmosphere and character development. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Tregillis When I was a kid, I had a subscription to Omni and this story made me love Martin.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandkings_(novelette) [spoilers, it’s Wikipedia] I had no idea that it was the same guy who did Game of Thrones until I went back to the Omni and saw his name there. I highly recommend Sandkings. It holds up well. Another anecdote with regard to the above tweet about everything Trump is doing now reverting back to the old DEI ways once he is gone. Based on what I am hearing – I do not believe that is going to be the case. I had occasion to speak to a CEO of a major US corporation – non-tech – this week.  He is one who has been on places like CNBC over the years hewing the Democratic Party, but not necessarily the woke, line. I was informed that the DEI stuff, thank God, was finally dead.  Most if not all of corporate America recognized the disaster it was years ago – but it took the Biden Administration and its full-throated implementation of it to really show the disaster.  Most of his CEO friends have been quietly planning to ditch the whole thing once the All Clear was somehow given.  Then enter Trump.  The ditching is now underway. His comments to me –  1)  A direct order from the C Suite – any and all applications with he/him, etc or any other kind of gender or such references were to be instantly trashed.  No questions asked.  They also had a very aggressive social media detective or two on staff to go over applicant’s social media very carefully.  He reported they had one disaster after the other with employees like this — the he/him etc meant one of two things – they actually believed this stuff and therefore were not attached to the real world – OR they did not have the balls to stand up to the cray cray.  We have neither the resources nor the will to deal with it anymore.  That had apparently been going on for a few years. 2)  Absolutely no more employees in the corporate suite from Ivy League schools and he said about 20 others specifically mentioning U of Chicago.  They cannot think for themselves, they are profoundly lazy, and are instant troublemakers.  We are very satisfied with all of our choices from places like Wichita State and other non-Ivy places.  We just no longer waste the time. Thus confirming the past few weeks where a WSJ article described that graduates of the Harvard Business School in a completely unprecedented situation were having trouble even getting interviews.  And also just glancing at reddit pages from my hometown – all kinds of the he/him crowd are lamenting no jobs, etc – while all of my family members not in that woke category seem to be having no trouble. I think that corporate America has been waiting to pounce like this – and then Trump’s first week happened – and I think we are about to see some major changes.  And I do not think it will be going back anytime soon.  And I am very happy about that.  As I said yesterday – they can go learn to code.  That was the response for years that was good enough for my people. DEI became the haven of grifters. I’m sure some of them actually mean it, but far too many just wanted the money that came with a do-nothing job or some of that sweet consulting cash. I once had to attend a 2-hour call where the corporate head of DEI gave an update on their progress to hire 50% women, 50% minorities, etc. I found it very ironic that the entire corporate HR department (including the head of the DIE) were 100% women and about 75% minority. At work, I just want to do my job, be left alone, and have as little to do with HR as possible. I agree that we shouldn’t be discriminating against people because of what they look like. But at some point, diversity became more about looks and not at all about ideas. They hire all these people that look different, but think exactly the same. And I really don’t want to work with people that take offense at the slightest perceived micro-aggression. I love this: Most of his CEO friends have been quietly planning to ditch the whole thing once the All Clear was somehow given. 1) A direct order from the C Suite – any and all applications with he/him, etc or any other kind of gender or such references were to be instantly trashed […] – OR they did not have the balls to stand up to the cray cray. Which is it? Do we get to trash the CEOs for being craven and useless for not standing up to the cray cray or is that only for the plebs? I have a hard time believing the CEOs are all amazing, alpha, get things done people when they’re incapable of standing against with the wind. If anything, this celebration just shows how pathetically weak these people are. Your second point is very interesting. Time was when you came from one of those elite schools that it was a golden ticket. Not any more it seems and I wonder what the academic standards are like at those institutions are like right now. I guess that there are no longer any safe spaces in the corporate suite. The Bud Light fiasco would have shown corporations the folly of having such people in charge. The Voice of Authority speaks, and he’s finally heard! We’ll get this straight from the top down! How did any of that ever have anything to do with him? Other than him making people who work for him sit through BS that he said they had to. Did he get sidelined for Emperor? The idea that these guys are brave for finally speaking truth to power is completely belied by the fact that they are the power… I agree with you 100% about growing a pair.\nIt is a disgrace. However, I also do know the unbelievable amount of pressure that has been exerted by all kinds of NGOs and organizations.  The threats were very real – you participate or we will destroy you – and these organizations collected a few scalps for all to see to maintain the threats.  In many ways, they were being extorted.  It was like a Mafia shake down. In that regard, the big vibe shift that is also going on is many of these extortion racket groups are now subject to howls of ridicule.  The whole extortion racket is breaking down.  They have pushed this way too far and done too many imbecile things.  The media groups that were once so powerful to run interference and protect them have now so besmirched their credibility that no one believes a thing they say.  Payday has arrived.  And they seem to be flailing – they have no idea how to handle their new lot in life.  It is fascinating to watch. Common sense breaks away from the HR tractor beam on occasion. Bullying to force conformance under penalty of ostracism, rebranded as cancelling. Supplement that with media campaigns to continue the pretense that those people really are not batshit crazy, until someone drops the penny or a few rolls of pennies. Or a little kid points out the Emperor’s lack of clothes.\nAmusing if not for the collateral damage all around. Most of this, to me, is cause for Bacchanalian celebration. Downside: no doubt the “very aggressive social media detectives” are also going after any mention of Gaza.  But most of this is well-earned blowback. Really would love to know the 20 schools on that list.  And what happens now to all those corporate DEI officers?  Out on their asses in the cold of January? Will no one think of the children?

I realize this order does still leave just a bit of room for obfuscation and delay — but not much.  The implications of all this make my blood run cold and hot at the same time: 1)  He’s issuing this order on the 3rd day of his term.  This is a clear shot at the security state.\n2)  The optics of this were sparkling.  Adding RFK and MLK to the order, doing this right after MLK Day, “give that to RFK Jr.” — these were all masterstrokes.\n3)  I noted the reference in the text of the executive order to the Director of National Intelligence.  That’s TG.  If the JFK report is due in 15 days, perhaps this is an indication that Trump expects to cut off the debate sooner or later and get confirmation.\n4)  I can’t help but be impressed by his courage in doing this, even if it’s symbolic.  He even said himself before signing, “oh this is a big one”.  I wonder if two assassination attempts have convinced him to go for broke, if this is payback, or something else?   Whatever it is, I think this is the biggest thing he’s ever done. Well, I guess Trump’s speech at WEF could be called: “USA: We Have More Than Everybody”.\nAlllriiighty thennnn…… Trump wants nuclear reduction talks with China, Russia” [The Hill] He probably had a great big new idea, to create an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The US and Russia have huge nuclear arsenals but China is rapidly catching up complicating any US plans to take out China. These talks would just be an effort to put a lid on China’s nukes which the US tried to do in the past without success. But since the US has spent the last two decades pulling out of any nuke-related treaty that there is, how could Russia and China trust that anything would come out of any such talks. Trump is trying to jawbone interest rates down on his command and yet the 10-year yield ticked up a few basis points. Is he playing a political game with Powell or does he really have so much hubris that he thinks bonds behave like his shitcoins? Maybe both. I think there may be fireworks at next week’s FOMC presser. Remember what happened after the last last one? I too think this is going to be very interesting. By the way, I remember late last week a big story that Yellen had ordered extraordinary measures for the debt limit on Monday.  Monday came and went and no story. Did I miss something? Can you imagine wanting to talk to Peter Doocy? His whole affect is GIANT DB. Weirdos all I think Trump should send out $600 Checks along with a note saying “Here’s the $600 Joe Biden promised you and did not deliver.\nI deliver.” And if the $Trumpet totally discredits Crypto at a cost of $30,000,000,000 it would be a bargain. Definitely. Have you noticed the slew of “Big Extra Benefit Cheques Going Out” videos on the social media lately? I think that all of them are some sort of clickbait, but the timing is suspicious. Fukuyama’s End of History, heh, I heard of that from a half hour long but quite watchable socialist video critique of the Harry Potter stories and movies.  The video narrator claims the Potter books were written in the 1990s and showed a viewpoint of peak Blairism and Fukuyama-ism.  It did a great job spelling out the vague things that I didn’t like about the Potter books, and this was way before the whole transphobia thing broke.  Like how could their be poverty (the Weasley family) in the wizarding world, when you could make anything you wanted with magic? “Harry Potter and the End of History”, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mxgSq1wiPk Reports coming in from friends in various locations that there were ICE raids in New Jersey and Michigan today. Some “communist” ngo’s  may try to expand their reach to provide services eliminated by the Trump-Republican-billionaire regime’s dismantling of the federal workforce. However, my assumption is that the regime will implement the second paragraph of that tweet, and that if they think there’s any federal work that shouldn’t be eliminated entirely it will be privatized to billionaire-enhancing profit or non-profit entities. Alexander Mercouris mentioned on YT today that Trump has suspended shipment of military arms to Ukraine for 90 days pending review. I’m not sure how much is in the pipeline or already stockpiled in Ukraine, but I suspect that it’s not going to take much for Ukraine to collapse even faster than is already occurring.  We’ll know something’s up if the EU (and UK) elites start freaking out even more than they already have. Let’s hope the fighting will end, and lives can be saved. You need to be careful about Mercouris. This was debunked by Politico two days ago: https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-foreign-aid-freeze-war-in-ukraine-weapons/%5D The link goes to a “That Page is Gone” screen. The problem with Yarvin’s response is that Roosevelt, upon becoming president in the depths of the Great Depression, did not ‘essentially’ take power against the will of Congress or threaten as much. He merely raised the possibility of asking Congress to give him emergency powers if the legislative process ran aground. . . throw FDR under the bus! A dictatorship exists when state decision-making is centralized into one person.  Under FDR, decision-making was centralized into FDR, and the only real resistance came from the Supreme Court, and he was able to intimidate the Judiciary into rubber-stamping his agenda in short order.  FDR, president for life, was a “de facto” dictator, he didn’t formally abolish Congress, he simply had them in his pocket.  My guess is that Yarvin does not actually care about what the Constitution says, he is concerned with how power actually operates.  The only president that came close to FDR was Lincoln, and Lincoln was handling a national insurrection, FDR just started with a severe economic crisis, but still consolidated power and ruled for life. If dictator = bad, and FDR = good, then FDR was not a dictator.  If dictator = concentration of decision-making into unitary executive, then FDR = dictator, I don’t think there can be any argument based on how things operated.  Yes, you would have to concede Stalin had more juice than FDR, but then FDR wasn’t fighting off a Nazi invasion.   The Imperator was the commander of the armed forces.  The USA provides that the President is the commander in chief so if you want to be literal, the USA has a dictatorial constitution.  Yes, only Congress has the war power, but they haven’t actually acted as anything other than a rubber stamp to the executive since 1812.  Its a very modern notion that there is some kind of conflict between a constitution providing for a separation of powers and a dictatorship.  Any President ever been impeached for committing an act of war without congressional authorization?  In fact, a constitution providing for a separation of powers is the best outfit you can find to clothe a dictatorship.  When you call the shots, why would you want to disturb the fig leaf that helps to legitimate your rule? Your email address will not be published.

Our community-based participatory research partnership examined factors associated with COVID-19 testing and vaccination within a particularly hidden, underserved, and vulnerable population: Spanish-speaking Latines. In 2023, native Spanish-speaking Latine interviewers conducted phone-based structured individual assessments with 180 Spanish-speaking, predominantly immigrant Latines across North Carolina. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine associations between participant characteristics and COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Participant mean age was 41.7 (SD = 13), and 77.2% of the sample reported being cisgender women. Most participants reported immigrating from Latin American countries (89.9%), being uninsured (66.1%), and lacking US immigration documentation (51.1%). While most reported ever being COVID-19 tested (83.3%) and ever being vaccinated against COVID-19 (84.4%), only 24% were up to date with vaccination. Nearly half of the sample reported one or more barriers to COVID-19 testing, and over one-quarter reported one or more barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with ever being tested (P = .031). Fewer concerns about the vaccine, including fewer worries about side effects and having more confidence in vaccine effectiveness and safety, was associated with ever being vaccinated (P < .001). Spanish-speaking Latines face barriers to getting tested and vaccinated against COVID-19. Although ever testing and ever vaccination rates were high, being up to date with recommended vaccinations was low. Educational attainment and concerns about the vaccine were associated with COVID-19 testing and vaccination, respectively. Our findings suggest the need for culturally congruent strategies to address the challenges facing Spanish-speaking Latines in the United States.

Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States continue to carry disproportionate rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality compared to their non-Latine White counterparts, and this is particularly true of US Latine communities [1]. Despite comprising 19.1% of the US population [2], since the beginning of the pandemic, Latines comprised 24.1% of reported COVID-19 cases [3]. Additionally, Latines in the United States also have experienced disproportionately high rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality remains higher among Latines [4]. Throughout the pandemic and continuing today, these disparities have been notably more pronounced among Spanish-speaking Latines [5–7]. Complex factors continue to drive low rates of COVID-19 testing and vaccination within Latine communities in the United States [1, 7, 8]. These factors include poverty, limited resources, and institutional and structural barriers (e.g., discrimination and limited transportation). Latines may have limited access to culturally congruent and updated information about COVID-19 testing and vaccination, including eligibility and how to access these services; believe they are not at risk for COVID-19; worry about missing work due to a positive test result or vaccine side effects; and assume that they must pay for a test or vaccine. Other challenges include fear of engaging with government systems (including public health) and concerns about the long-term health implications of testing and vaccination. These barriers are even greater among those who do not speak English [1, 7–12]. Previous research has also suggested that undocumented persons and those living in mixed-immigration status households may face more significant challenges in accessing health services, resulting in comparatively poorer health outcomes compared to their documented counterparts [8–12]. For many Latine persons, factors, such as the fear of deportation or the deportation of family members, uncertainty about required documentation, a desire to limit possible interactions with law enforcement, and racial profiling, have been linked to reduced use of health services [1, 13, 14]. Our community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership’s preliminary research identified additional barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccination, including misinformation about testing and vaccination communicated through Spanish-language TV and social media platforms, as well as through word-of-mouth within social networks; medical mistrust; and distrust in the test or vaccine itself (e.g., not believing that they will get the real vaccine as has been reported in Latin America [7, 11, 15–17]. Participants in our preliminary research also reported that many Latines do not trust, feel discouraged from using, and encounter difficulty accessing and navigating the US healthcare system, particularly non-English speakers and those less familiar with how to obtain healthcare resources and services in the United States [7]. Furthermore, it is well documented that some Latines fear using public health services given experiences with racial/ethnic discrimination, anti-immigration rhetoric, and policies and laws that discourage or restrict access [7, 13, 18–20]. Moreover, participants highlighted concern regarding some immigration policies, such as Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Secure Communities program [13], sanctuary city status [14, 21], and “public charge” (term used by US immigration officials and the media for individuals considered likely to become dependent on the government for subsistence). These policies may contribute to a reduced perception of access to and a disincentive for using COVID-related services. Many Latines are concerned that seeking these services might expose them or their family members to immigration enforcement actions or lead to adverse legal consequences related to their immigration status [1, 7]. Our CBPR partnership sought to better understand COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine persons living in North Carolina. While understanding of testing and vaccination is expanding, most studies do not focus on this population (i.e., Spanish-speaking and immigrant Latine persons in the US South) that tends to be hidden, underserved, and vulnerable. This analysis is part of a larger parent intervention study to assess the impact of an intervention harnessing natural helping through community-based peer navigators (known as Navegantes) and mHealth to increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine in North Carolina [1]. The parent study and this analysis were conceived and developed by our long-standing CBPR partnership, consisting of members from academic research institutions and representatives of Latine community organizations in North Carolina [1]. Additionally, the parent study is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) initiative. The primary objectives of RADx-UP are to understand and mitigate the disparities in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality experienced by communities disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States (https://radx-up.org/). Cross-sectional baseline data from the parent study are used in this analysis. Data were collected across North Carolina, a state with a population of over 1 million Latines, over a third of whom are foreign-born [2, 22]. To recruit participants, we relied on our partnership’s extensive community networks throughout North Carolina, utilizing recruitment flyers and word-of-mouth strategies. To be eligible for this study, participants (a) self-identified as Hispanic/Latine, (b) spoke Spanish fluently, (c) were ≥18 years old, and (d) provided informed consent. Between February 9 and March 11, 2023, we recruited, enrolled, and collected baseline data from 20 Navegantes and their social network members (n = 8 unique social network members per Navegante) for a total of 180 Spanish-speaking Latines. Data were collected via an interviewer-administered structured individual assessment and entered using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Data were collected on the phone by trained native Spanish-speaking interviewers to assist with challenges associated with low-literacy rates and/or poor vision. Each assessment was completed in about 45 minutes, depending on responses to specific items and corresponding branching logic. Human subject oversight was provided by the Institutional Review Board of Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The structured individual assessment contained a total of 142 items with predefined response categories. Most items were drawn from the RADx-UP Common Data Elements and PhenX toolkit (https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) to ensure standardization of measurement across studies funded by the RADx-UP initiative. Our partnership supplemented these items with additional items that we have used within Latine communities in the US South. The assessment was organized by domain and included sociodemographics, insurance status, immigration documentation, behaviors, testing status and barriers, vaccination status and barriers, and psychosocial factors. All measures have been validated among Spanish-speaking Latine populations living in the United States previously. Ever testing for COVID-19 was assessed using the item: “Have you ever been tested for COVID-19?”. Ever vaccination for COVID-19 and whether vaccination was up to date was assessed using the items: “Have you received a COVID-19 vaccination?”, “How many shots against COVID-19 have you received?”, “Who was the manufacturer of the first shot you received?”, “Who was the manufacturer of the most recent shot you received?”, “On what date did you receive your first shot against COVID-19?”, and “On what date did you receive your most recent shot against COVID-19?”. Participants were considered up to date if they had received an appropriate primary series (for mRNA vaccines, 2 doses, and for adenoviral vector vaccines, 1 dose) and had received a booster with a bivalent formulation in September 2022 or later; this criterion was based on the recommendations for vaccination at the time of assessment completion [23]. These items were required by the RADx-UP initiative or adapted from required items. Sociodemographic data included age in years, gender identity, country of origin, language fluency, years living in North Carolina, educational attainment, employment status, and household income. Insurance status was assessed using the item: “What is the primary kind of health insurance or health care plan that you have now?” with response options including: “I do not have health instance”, “Private (purchased directly or through employment)”, “Public (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare)”, “Don’t know”, and “Prefer not to answer”. These items were required by the RADx-UP initiative or adapted from required items. Self-reported general health status was assessed using the item: “Would you say your health in general is excellent (1), very good (2), good (3), fair (4), or poor (5)?” This commonly used item was also required by the RADX-UP initiative and is highly reliable and considered to be a good assessment of a person’s well-being [24]. Immigration documentation status was assessed using the following three items: “Do you currently have a \"green card?”, “Do you currently have a valid student visa, valid tourist visa, work permit, or another legal immigration status such as deferred action?”, and “Do you have or have you obtained citizenship in the US?” response options included “No”, “Yes”, and “Prefer not to answer”. These items have been validated previously [14]. Eight barriers to testing and 10 barriers to vaccination were assessed. Barriers to getting tested were: “Need to take time off work to get tested”; “out-of-pocket costs for test”; “out-of-pocket costs for transportation, childcare, or time off work”; “I do not know where to go to be tested”; “pain or discomfort from the test”; “saliva”; “concern about others handling my personal data”; and “other”. Barriers to getting vaccinated were: “I’m allergic to vaccines”; “I don’t like needles”; “I’m not concerned about getting really sick form COVID-19”; “I’m concerned about side effects from the vaccine”; “I don’t think vaccines work very well”; “I don’t trust that the vaccine will be safe”; “I don’t believe the COVID-19 pandemic is as bad as some people say it is”; “I don’t want to pay for it”; I don’t know enough about how well a COVID-19 vaccine works”; and “other”. These items were required by the RADx-UP initiative. We also assessed social support using the Oslo-3 Social Support Scale [25]. The sum score of the three items ranges from 3 to 14, with high values representing strong levels and low values representing poor levels of social support; this score can be operationalized into three broad categories of social support: (1) 3–8 poor social support, (2) 9–11 moderate social support, (3) 12–14 strong social support. We assessed COVID-19 testing intention using the single item “I plan to get tested as often as needed”; this item was required by the RADx-UP initiative. Provider communication self-efficacy was assessed using a single item from the Patient Activation Measure [26]: “I am confident I can tell my health care provider concerns I have even when they do not ask”. Provider discrimination was assessed using two items developed by our CBPR partnership: “Health care providers discriminate against people like me” and “I have personally been treated unfairly by doctors or healthcare workers because of my ethnicity or race”. Testing intention, provider communication self-efficacy, and discrimination were scored on a Likert-scale from Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (4). Latine community attachment was assessed using the item: “How much do you feel a part of or connected to the Latino community?” Response options ranged from “Not at all a part of or connected to” (0) to “Very much a part of or connected to” (3). This item was developed by our CBPR partnership and has been successfully used in the past [27, 28]. Descriptive statistics such as mean (M), standard deviation (SD), frequency (n), and percentage (%) were used to describe the sample and study measures. Coefficient omega was used to estimate reliability via internal consistency for social support. Given sample size and model building recommendations [29], we first performed univariate screening of potential independent variables (to use in multivariable modeling) using Akaike information criteria (AIC) [30] and c statistics. AIC is useful for comparing models in a relative sense between two or more candidate regression models. The AIC calculation is a function of the number of independent variables used to build the model and the estimate of the likelihood for the model. The lower the AIC score the better. The number of independent variables used per outcome (i.e., COVID-19 testing and vaccination) for each multivariable model was selected based on established guidelines [29]. After the selection of the independent variables (based on AIC), multivariable logistic regression was performed to model relationships between independent variables and ever testing, ever vaccination, and up-to-date vaccination. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for model effects. Similarly, linear regression was performed for agreement rating of getting tested as needed. A random intercept for the participant social network was specified to account for potential within-network clustering, which was estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multicollinearity was assessed with variance inflation factors (VIFs), and all VIFs were less than three except for years in the United States and North Carolina; thus, these were modeled separately where appropriate. A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Among the total sample of participants (N = 180), the mean age was 41.7 years (SD = 12.9), and 77.2% identified as cisgender women. Most were born outside of the United States; the most frequent Latin American countries of origin included Mexico (43.9%), Colombia (12.8%), and El Salvador (6.8%). The majority of participants (87.2%) had resided in the United States for more than two years, and the mean number of years living in North Carolina was 14.1 years (SD = 8.7; range: 0.2–36.0). Many participants also reported educational attainment of less than high school or GED equivalent (24.4%) or high school or GED equivalent (36.7%), currently working (67.2%), lacking health insurance (66.1%), and lacking US immigration documentation (51.1%). Nearly half (46.7%) of participants reported experiencing one or more barriers to COVID-19 testing, and more than one-quarter (28.3%) reported experiencing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. The mean number of barriers for testing and vaccination were 0.6 (SD = 0.7) and 0.5 (SD = 0.9), respectively. Participants reported moderate levels of testing intentions with a mean of 2.6 (SD = 0.9), overall social support with a mean score of 10.1 (SD = 2.0), provider communication self-efficacy with a mean score of 2.8 (SD = 0.4), provider discrimination with a mean score of 2.4 (SD = 0.5), and Latine community attachment with a mean score of 1.8 (SD = 0.9). Table 1 outlines selected study sample characteristics.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0317794.t001 The vast majority of the sample reported ever being tested (83.3%; 95% CI = 77.2%, 88.1%) and ever being vaccinated (84.4%; 95% CI = 78.4%, 89.0%). This includes at least one dose of the recommended vaccines. However, only 24.4% were up to date on their vaccination (95% CI = 18.7%, 31.2%). Of the 136 participants who were not up to date with their vaccination, 79.4% (n = 108) reported having at least one COVID-19 vaccine.

In multivariable modeling, no univariately screened characteristics were statistically significantly associated with being up to date on vaccination in multivariable modeling (Table 4).  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0317794.t004 This analysis aimed to explore COVID-19 testing and vaccination within a sample of Spanish-speaking Latines in North Carolina; over half of our sample lacked US immigration documentation. Throughout the pandemic, this population has experienced disproportionate rates of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, and Latines currently remain a highly vulnerable population. Data used in this analysis are part of a parent study designed to understand COVID-19 testing and vaccination and develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention designed to promote COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Latine communities [1]. This research is critical given that data were collected in 2023, well into the COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 testing became widespread in Spring 2020, and COVID-19 vaccination began in December 2020. Participants had high rates of both testing and vaccination, suggesting a willingness within this community to engage with public health efforts designed to control the spread of COVID-19. However, participants with lower educational attainment (i.e., high school or GED equivalent or below) were less likely to report ever testing. Our findings align with existing literature, which suggests that educational disparities can significantly impact health behaviors [1, 7]. Thus, future efforts to increase testing could benefit from tailored strategies that are designed to reach those with lower educational attainment with messages that are both understandable and meaningful. Furthermore, participants with any vaccination barriers were less likely to report being ever vaccinated. The most commonly reported vaccine barriers included: concerns about the side effects of the vaccine, lack of confidence in vaccine effectiveness, and worries about vaccine safety. Our findings are consistent with research indicating that concerns about side effects can hinder vaccination efforts [8–12]. These concerns may stem from misinformation or previous negative experiences with the US healthcare system. Future efforts to increase vaccination could benefit from tailored strategies and messages that are designed to address these concerns. Moreover, despite COVID-19 vaccine availability, less than a quarter of participants were up to date with vaccination. This means that while a significant number initiated vaccination, a considerably smaller percentage remained current. Among the 136 participants who were not up to date on their vaccination, 79.4% had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine. Our study contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating that participants who had been initially vaccinated had experiences with vaccination and public health systems but did not reengage as needed. This suggests that their acceptance of vaccines and testing may have been driven by specific circumstances, such as emergency conditions or work and travel requirements rather than the awareness of the importance of testing and vaccination. Given those barriers to testing and vaccination were low, reasons for not being up to date could have included COVID-19 fatigue, confusing messaging about who needed vaccination (including boosters), potential negative side effects, and/or perceptions that COVID-19 was less serious over time. Because these participants would have been identifiable through their vaccination records, there may have been a missed opportunity for targeted, tailored, and personalized outreach about updating one’s COVID-19 to ensure higher rates of being up to date. In this analysis, over half of participants were undocumented, and we expected immigration documentation status to be associated with COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and being up to date with vaccinations. It is well established that being undocumented can be a profound barrier to health care [31]. However, in our modeling, we did not find an association. This may be because Latine communities found alternative ways to access COVID-19 testing and vaccination, such as community health centers, mobile clinics, or community-wide public health testing and vaccination campaigns, which have been, for the most part, less contingent on documentation status throughout the COVID-19 pandemic than other types of healthcare providers. Furthermore, during the height of the pandemic, testing and vaccination were sometimes paired with other services, such as food pantries, and in places that were familiar to Latines [7]. Additionally, government mandates or public health initiatives may have prioritized equitable access to COVID-19 services regardless of immigration status, thereby mitigating the impact of documentation status as a barrier. Several limitations to the study should be acknowledged. First, these findings are based on cross-sectional data. Additional studies using a prospective cohort design will be necessary to evaluate the significance and stability of these findings over time. Furthermore, the results of this study may not apply to the general population of Latine adults. However, the degree of fit between a sample and a target population about which generalizations can be made is a common challenge in many studies; in fact, many studies of COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Latine communities are based on non-random and potentially nonrepresentative samples. In this case, however, we have reached a highly hidden, underserved, and vulnerable population: Spanish-speaking and immigrant Latines in North Carolina. Furthermore, this structured individual assessment was interviewer administered, which in some populations can lead to socially desirable responses. However, our CBPR partnership has learned that careful rapport building can result in increased understanding of items and more accurate responses. Additionally, the interviewer used validated wording that emphasized confidentiality as well as the importance of honest answers. This study provides several significant strengths that enhance its contribution to the understanding of COVID-19 uptake in the Spanish-speaking Latine community. First, by engaging community leaders (Navegantes), we effectively reached a hard-to-access population. These trusted leaders facilitated participation, fostering a sense of safety and encouraging community members. Also, our research team included Spanish-speaking Latines who were not only fluent in the language but also familiar with the cultural nuances of the community. This allowed us to communicate effectively be culturally congruent, which are essential for building trust and rapport and ensuring comprehension. The team also had the flexibility to talk with participants at times convenient for them, accommodating their schedules and increasing the likelihood of participation. This adaptability is crucial when working with communities that may have varying commitments and availability. Spanish-speaking Latines face challenges in getting tested and vaccinated for COVID-19. Although ever testing and ever vaccination rates were high in this study, being up to date with recommended vaccinations was low. Educational attainment and concerns about the vaccine were associated with COVID-19 testing and vaccination, respectively. To promote health equity, our findings suggest the need for culturally congruent strategies to address the barriers facing Spanish-speaking Latines and immigrant Latines in the United States.

Sen. Rand Paul has vowed to continue investigating the COVID origins question, and sources tell RealClearInvestigations that Sen. Ron Johnson and House Republican investigators plan to do so as well. When testifying in those inquiries or answering written depositions, Fauci will be unable to dodge questions by invoking his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. ‘They can ask him if he lied before, replough old ground,’ Foster said. ‘And if he lies about any prior lie, he can be prosecuted for that or held in contempt.'” That is: “Biden’s pardon negates the two Senate referrals for criminal activity.

Executive Orders (EOs): “Behind-the-Scenes Aide Narrates Trump’s Day One Executive Actions” [RealClearPolitics]. “Back at the White House, on the evening of his second inauguration, President Trump did something on the first day that his predecessor never bothered to do in four years: He sat and took questions in the Oval Office as reporters peppered him with questions. It was the newest set piece in the second season of Trump, and in that moment, as the president signed executive order after executive order, an obscure staffer was catapulted to unlikely stardom. Will Scharf, the new White House staff secretary, stood by the president’s side and before the cameras, announcing the actions just before Trump put his black Sharpie to paper. Asked Trump, ‘What’s this one?’ Replied the staffer handing him paperwork bound in a black portfolio, ‘Withdrawing from the World Health Organization.’ Said the president, ‘Oh, that’s a big one.’ In this way, Scharf served as impromptu master of ceremonies for the first step in the attempted erasure of former President Biden’s legacy.” And: “A stack of those orders, each bound in black leather portfolios, had grown into a small mountain on the Resolute Desk by the end of the evening, each a step toward achieving what the president promised would be a ‘golden age of America.’ And in that moment, Scharf was the unexpected emcee. Soon the lawyer will recuse his speaking role and likely recede from public view. His influence within the White House, however, will not.” • A well-engineered spectable indeed — especially since Scharf was only asked by Trump to do the honors at the last minute (a small insight into why his staff might be loyal to him). * * * “Trump executive orders smash leftist pieties that kept America paralyzed’ [Editorial Board, New York Post]. More interesting is the take at the end: “Trump’s still giving his inner troll some room to play, renaming Alaska’s Denali Mt. McKinley (as it was called pre-Obama) and the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. But his vision is blessedly forward-looking — to the better, brighter vistas that Biden and his party refuse to see. That willful blindness cost them the election. America, in love with the future as always, is right there with Trump.” • The polling says that “America” is not. So we’ll see. * * * “Trump administration directs all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on leave” [Associated Press]. ” President Donald Trump’s administration has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off…. The executive order on affirmative action revokes an order issued by President Lyndon Johnson, and curtails DEI programs by federal contractors and grant recipients. It’s using one of the key tools utilized by the Biden administration to promote DEI programs across the private sector — pushing their use by federal contractors — to now eradicate them…. [F]ederal workers are being asked to report to Trump’s Office of Personnel Management if they suspect any DEI-related program has been renamed to obfuscate its purpose within 10 days or face ‘adverse consequences.'” That said, there are implementation issues: ‘Despite the sweeping language of Trump’s order, [Noreen Farrell, executive director of gender rights group Equal Rights Advocates] said, ‘the reality of implementing such massive structural changes is far more complex.’ ‘Federal agencies have deeply embedded policies and procedures that can’t simply be switched off overnight,’ she added.” • That’s a lot of PMC, especially in Northern Virginia and Maryland, suddenly uncertain of their employment prospects. “Donald Trump’s Medicare Executive Order Explained” [Newsweek]. “The potential impact of rescinding executive order 14087 is as follows: 1. Halted development of cost-reduction models: The directive for the Department of Health and Human Services to develop and test new models aimed at lowering drug costs through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has been withdrawn. This move could slow or halt progress on initiatives that were designed to make prescription medications more affordable. 2. Potential increase in out-of-pocket expenses: Without the implementation of new models focused on reducing costs, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries might continue to face high out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs, possibly affecting access to certain medications. 3. Uncertainty in future drug pricing policies: The rescission creates uncertainty regarding the federal government’s approach to addressing prescription drug costs, which could leave beneficiaries unsure about future measures to control or reduce expenses.” But as usual implementation: “While the executive order has been rescinded, existing laws and regulations governing prescription drug pricing and Medicare and Medicaid policies remain in effect. However, the measures from the previous administration that they say was designed to save on costs has now been disrupted.” “A Trump Executive Order Could End The Government-Censorship Complex” [The Federalist]. “Trump’s executive order — just one in a slough of Inauguration Day measures — seeks to enforce the First Amendment, ‘essential to the success of our Republic.'” But once again implementation: “It is unclear what steps the Trump administration will take, pursuant to this order, to investigate or shut down agencies or partnerships that constitute the government-censorship complex.” “Trump’s blanket Jan. 6 pardons stun Republicans on Capitol Hill” [The Hill]. “President Trump’s sweeping pardons of more than 1,500 people charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, including individuals who assaulted police officers, stunned Republican lawmakers who witnessed firsthand the chaos on Capitol Hill four years ago. Trump’s action, which defied assurances from his allies that he would examine convictions on a case-by-case basis and not grant clemency to people who committed violence, divided GOP senators and overshadowed talk about his first-100-days agenda. GOP lawmakers are largely willing to overlook the hundreds of people who entered the Capitol illegally four years ago, which disrupted the certification of former President Biden’s victory by several hours, but pardoning people who assaulted Capitol Police, causing dozens of injuries, was hard to swallow. ‘It is wrong to pardon individuals convicted of violent crime, especially when many of the victims of their violence were law enforcement officers,’ Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said in a statement. Moran was expressing a view shared by many of his Senate GOP colleagues, even though many of them are reluctant to criticize Trump publicly.” “22 states sue to stop Trump’s order blocking birthright citizenship” [Associated Press]. “Attorneys general from 22 states sued Tuesday to block President Donald Trump’s move to end a century-old immigration practice known as birthright citizenship guaranteeing that U.S.-born children are citizens regardless of their parents’ status. Trump’s roughly 700-word executive order, issued late Monday, amounts to a fulfillment of something he’s talked about during the presidential campaign. But whether it succeeds is far from certain amid what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle over the president’s immigration policies and a constitutional right to citizenship. The Democratic attorneys general and immigrant rights advocates say the question of birthright citizenship is settled law and that while presidents have broad authority, they are not kings.” And: “Ratified in 1868 in in the aftermath of the Civil War, the 14th Amendment says: ‘All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.'” • A strict constructionist reading the Fourteenth Amendment would surely support the Democrats. * * * “How Trump Is Pushing at Limits of Presidential Power in Early Orders” [Charlie Savage, New York Times]. “On Monday, as Mr. Trump took the oath of office to begin his second term, he asserted a muscular vision of presidential power. He not only revived some of the same expansive understandings of executive authority that were left unaddressed, but went even further with new claims of sweeping and inherent constitutional clout. Among a blizzard of executive orders, Mr. Trump instructed prosecutors not to enforce a law that bans the popular social media app TikTok until its Chinese owner sells it. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had signed the measure into law after it passed with broad bipartisan support, and the Supreme Court unanimously upheld it. Whatever the law’s merits, the Constitution says presidents ‘shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.’ Mr. Trump offered no clear explanation for how he has any legitimate power to instead suspend the law, making only a vague gesture toward his ‘constitutional responsibility’ for national security, foreign policy ‘and other vital executive functions.'” And several of the EOs (border security; energy) depend on invoking Presidential emergency powers. “But facts matter little to whether or when it is legal for presidents to invoke emergency power, declarations that are governed by the National Emergencies Act of 1976. That law does not tightly define the circumstances under which presidents may determine that an emergency exists, leaving them with essentially unfettered discretion to unlock exigent powers for themselves. But previous presidents adhered to norms of self-restraint.” • The Norms Fairy sheds another tear. * * * AI: “Trump announces private-sector $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure” [Reuters]. “U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outpace rival nations in the business-critical technology. Trump said that ChatGPT’s creator OpenAI, SoftBank (9984.T), opens new tab and Oracle (ORCL.N), opens new tab are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said will build data centers and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch. The first of the project’s data centers are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference. Twenty will be built, half a million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyzes electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said. • That will be awesome; we’ll be able to have AI-powered upcoding then, or wherever the return is greatest (i.e., wherever fraud and rental extraction is maximized).

The political and enterprise value of “Musk Inc” is built on treacherous ideological sands…. Tesla has suffered its first year of falling car sales worldwide. It is running into ferocious competition on price and quality in China and is rapidly losing German market share in electric vehicles (EV) to BMW and Mercedes…. The driving rationale for the parabolic spike in the share price since Donald Trump’s election is the belief that Musk will enjoy techno-regulatory privilege and crony capitalist favour. The Tesla chief was still in good enough grace to earn a spot with the Trump family at the inauguration… His privilege is recompense for spending a quarter of $1bn helping Trump over the line in swing states – whether by fostering free speech or by exploiting the black arts of algorithmic propaganda, depends on your angle of view.” But: “The problem with the market’s political bet on Tesla is that Musk has already made himself arch-enemy of the Maga priesthood, who increasingly regard him as a globalist carpet-bagger. They think he is trying to subvert the ethno-cultural revival of the American nation state, spreading money around to capture the Trump movement for his own purposes.” And: “Musk has manoeuvred himself into an invidious position, caught between the Chinese Communist Party and the Maga movement and reliant on the fickle favour of a volatile American president.

I wonder if anyone else did? “Elon Musk’s salute falls flat: Why far-right trolling isn’t working this time around” [Amanda Marcotte, Salon]. “Most people, if they made this gesture innocently, would be upset about the neo-Nazis trying to claim common cause with them. As Ed Kilgore argued at New York Tuesday, ‘there is an easy way to clear this up, particularly for someone who owns a major social-media platform and uses it very often.’ All Musk needs to do is ‘make the gesture of denouncing fascism aggressively.’ He adds that explicitly rejecting fascism and white nationalism ‘should be worth a few dozen tweets, wouldn’t you say?'”  “Dimon says he and Musk have ‘hugged it out'” [The Hill]. “JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have “hugged it out” and resolved their differences, after Dimon’s bank sued the tech billionaire’s electric vehicle firm in 2021…. JPMorgan Chase sued Tesla in 2021, demanding $162 million from Musk’s firm as part of a stock warrant deal. The dispute centered on a 2018 tweet from the Tesla CEO, suggesting he might take the company private, and the subsequent changes in Tesla’s value. The tweet also prompted a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million to resolve in 2018. JPMorgan dropped the lawsuit against Telsa last month after the two companies reached a settlement…. Dimon said Wednesday he wished Musk and DOGE the best as they embark on their cost-cutting efforts. ‘I think it is completely rational for someone to look at our government and say it’s been ineffective,’ Dimon told CNBC.” * * *           The Wizard of Kalorama™ Untrue: The DNC has always struggled with respect to social media messaging…always been weak.

Trump’s hardline approach to immigration is popular, including deporting migrants, although Americans are still queasy when it comes to large-scale efforts that involve a heavy-handed government approach. Secondly, with Biden and Kamala Harris no longer in power, Democrats lack a leader. Members are asking themselves whether it’s former President Barack Obama, a Democratic governor, Jeffries, Harris or someone else…. House Democratic leaders opted not to whip against the Laken Riley Act, which ended up getting 48 Democratic votes. A revised Senate version will come back up for a final House vote today before it heads to Trump’s desk. Some Democrats wish Jeffries had taken a tougher stance against the bill, which allows ICE to take custody of migrants accused of certain crimes. But Jeffries likely would have gotten flack from Frontliners if he’d pressured members to vote no. In one of the first Democratic caucus meetings after the bruising November election, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), who represents a competitive district along the southern border, warned Democratic leaders not to tell him how to vote, according to a source familiar with the interaction. So far, Jeffries seems to be walking a very careful line. He’s made clear to members that they need to be able to vote their districts. Yet Jeffries is also counseling them not to take the Republican bait. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has been very outspoken on this issue, says House Democrats need to take the lead for the party since they have the best chance of winning back power in 2026. That puts Jeffries in the spotlight. ‘This is where the action is. This is where the margin is tightest. This is where we’re within striking distance of winning the majority back,’ Ocasio-Cortez said. ‘That would mean our leader and our leadership here.'” • I’m so old I remember when Sanders won the Hispanic counties along the Rio Grande. Speaking of so-called “frontliners.” “Why Are Democrats Joining Republicans and Voting for the Anti-Immigrant Laken Riley Act?” [Newsweek]. “It’s no surprise that Republicans supported this measure, as it aims to crack down on migrant crime. What’s mystifying is why some Democrats got behind this bill to hand Trump a victory on his signature issue. The Laken Riley Act is legally, logistically, and constitutionally unsound—and misguided Democrats helped make it happen. The Laken Riley Act requires the Department of Homeland Security to jail undocumented immigrants accused of burglary and theft, putting them on track for deportation. The key word here is accused. Under the measure’s provisions, people charged with minor crimes can be locked up without bail before they are convicted, even if charges against them are dropped. This flies in the face of the presumption of innocence, and violates due process, which the Supreme Court has ruled applies to undocumented immigrants…. Worse, the Laken Riley Act allows state attorneys general to sue the government over everything from individual immigration enforcement decisions to immigration policies. Why would 48 House Democrats, along with 12 senators like Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.) support this measure? Because political survival seems to be more important to them than legal and civil rights. Reeling from Trump’s presidential victory, these Democrats want to show that they can be tough on illegal immigration. How disappointing that they embraced a bill predicated on the unfounded link between migrants and criminality.

Stay safe out there!    Airborne Transmission “Aerosol research shows how easily COVID-19 can be caught through the air” [Medical Xpress]. A 2023 study, linked to here. But: “Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been discussions about how COVID-19 infections spread. Jakob Löndahl, professor in aerosol technology and a colleague of Alsved, was one of those who got involved with the ‘new virus’ early on. He paused his research on norovirus to investigate whether the infection from the then unknown virus was airborne. Much new knowledge about airborne transmission has emerged since the pandemic, and researchers now want to see if it can be applied to infectious diseases other than COVID-19. ‘The work on COVID-19 has raised many new questions. Do viral aerosols from other respiratory infections such as rhinoviruses, influenza and RSV spread in the same way as viruses from COVID-19? When is the risk of infection highest? How effective are our various protective measures? There are many questions we are working on now,’ concludes Löndahl.” • Indeed!

The study population included 37,606 patients from ten hospitals in Henan and 3,270 patients from one hospital in Xinjiang…. The primary outcome was all-cause death, with 469 deaths observed: 288 in the azvudine group and 181 in the Paxlovid group. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a significantly lower risk of death in the azvudine group compared with Paxlovid (p = 0.038). Multivariable Cox regression analysis confirmed this, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.676-0.987, p = 0.036). Composite disease progression occurred in 681 patients: 446 in the azvudine group and 235 in the Paxlovid group…. Sensitivity analyses supported the accuracy of these findings.

It needs the approvals to achieve certification of both long-delayed types and to roll out an angle-of-attack (AOA) system update planned for all Max models, says Boeing’s request, released by the US government on 21 January… The aircraft manufacturer has historically certificated SMYDs to ‘Level B’ standards under aircraft-software guidance published by the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics. Level B applies to software for which failures are ‘hazardous’, according to online sources. ‘During 737-7 development and certification of the yaw damper function, updated analysis led Boeing and the FAA to determine that the SMYD should now be certified to Design Assurance Level A,’ Boeing’s exemption request says. Level A systems are considered those for which failure may be ‘catastrophic’. Because the Max 7’s and Max 10’s SMYD has “not been shown to meet” Level A standards, “additional certification activity will be needed”, Boeing says. It has requested the exemption be valid through end-October 2028. Between now and then, Boeing intends to ‘complete the certification activities necessary to show compliance’, it says. “This period also provides the time needed to retrofit airplanes delivered under this exemption, in order to bring them into compliance.'” • So when exactly was the need to upgrade to Level A known, and how long was Boeing management sitting on it? Tech: “Instagram hides search results for ‘Democrats'” [BBC]. “While users who type ‘#Democrat’ or ‘#Democrats’ see no results, the hashtag ‘Republican’ returns 3.3 million posts on the social media platform. By manually searching Instagram for ‘Democrats’, rather than clicking on a hashtag, users are greeted by a screen reading ‘we’ve hidden these results.’ ‘Results for the term you searched for may contain sensitive content,’ it says. There are also limited results when people search for ‘Republicans’ as opposed to ‘Republican.'” • Even if this is an accident, the technical capability is still pretty frightening. * * * Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 45 Neutral (previous close: 40 Fear) [CNN].

Brody and Jones recorded their voices into the AI software, while Jancsó said he also fed in his voice to ‘finesse the tricky dialect.’ ‘Most of their Hungarian dialogue has a part of me talking in there,’ he added. ‘We were very careful about keeping their performances. It’s mainly just replacing letters here and there.’ Jancsó also revealed that generative AI was used in the final sequence of ‘The Brutalist’ to create a ‘series of architectural drawings and finished buildings’ in the style of Brody’s character, László Tóth.” • And so it begins.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\r\n\r\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I’d say when it comes to Felicity Jones all is forgiven except her improbable casting as Ruth Bader Ginsburg (may be good…haven’t actually seen it). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Basis_of_Sex Felicity Jones is not the (my) problem… Fellini’s movies were shot without sound recording with the original actors–but not always–dubbing them later. In fact this was common practice in post WW2 Europe. They could have solved this problem if they had all learned to talk American (eventually most of them did). Film movie cameras were quite noisy and the housings needed to fix this quite bulky. i love Fellini.\nAmarcord remains my fave.\nbut i like all those guys from that time and place.\nwhen netflix’ dvd thing had a deal with the criterion collection, i took bigtime advantage….made the boys watch Fellini, Kurosawa, and on and on.\nthey liked the Monty Python films the best.\nbut they still make reference to the rest. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Strada\ni dug that one, as well.\nthe best films are hard to watch. i liked her in The Diplomat.\nand i think she’s rather hot, too…so theres that,lol.\nbedhead,and lots of it, is one of my things. after 4 days in a furry hat, 24/7, you should see me….and im out of argan oil(1st world thing i treat myself to…less messy than olive oil for detangling, etc)\ni expect birds to move into this nest on my head at any moment. furry hat=acrylic walmart version of this:\nhttps://www.furhatworld.com/beaver-full-fur-russian-hat-beaver-hats-p-442.html i also have a big puffy one for going out to see to things when its like this.\nboth tie my hair in knots…like flyfishing windknots x 200. You can get that hat in raccoon fur for not much more than the synthetic and much less than the beaver. I’ve lived in Silicon Valley for 45 years. I used to own a long wool coat and would have killed for one of these hats. Now, it’s just tights and fleece in the winter; we’ve slowly warmed. We get no frost any more. The lesson to be learned from the early Picasso painting is that, to break the rules, you must first understand that which you desire to transcend. ambrit: Yep.  I am also reminded of the people who look at a painting by Picasso and blabber about how they can draw better. Oh?  As you write, he had mastered all the basics, and he kept on experimenting. It’s shocking that P was such an accomplished draftsman and painter at that age. Maybe his fellow classmates threw in the towel when they saw that particular work. Since Pierre Bourdieu enjoys a certain degree of popularity here, one would be remiss not to mention his work “Les règles de l’art”.  In it, he examines the importance of the fact that “to break the rules, you must first understand that which you desire to transcend” in the succession of artistic movements. There is much more in his book: about the positioning of artists (from tradition breakers to tradition keepers); their ways to achieve recognition (and recognition by other artists vs by institutional patrons vs by sponsors from the economic elite) vs to achieve economic sufficiency (these involve quite different strategies, achieving recognition usually involving seriously giving up economic advantages, at least initially); the importance of channels (such as art galleries or litterary “salons”) and their own positioning regarding artistic trends; the crucial role of women as promoters of artists (artists are in a lower social position and have therefore a lower social capital than the wealthy patrons from whom they seek support; the women belonging to those wealthy circles were, historically, on a lower social position than men; they were therefore best placed to serve as intermediaries between artists and the masculine economic elites — salons where they all mingled were organized by women); the relevance of the social background of the artists. And more. I recommend that opus. “A Trump Executive Order Could End The Government-Censorship Complex” I can believe that Trump is closing down the present structures of controlling social media, I don’t believe he is ending control.  After TikTok reopened, users are reporting that Palestine posts and other “sensitive” topics are suppressed. We have also the example of Facebook going “free speach” by allowing calling women and lgbt stupid (in less family friendly terms). Theoretically, these rules allow for me calling Zuckerberg stupid as long as I add that I write so because he is a man, cisgender or straight, but in reality I doubt it. Maybe Zuckerberg will copy Musk and call censoring the word “cisgender” free speach? This isn’t about free speach, it is about making sure the moderation supresses the enemies and not the supporters. Also heard from US facebook users that they have found their accounts following the accounts of Donald and Melania Trump. If anyone still uses facebook and is situated in the US, you might want to check if this applies to your account. What differs from the previous regime’s Government-Censorship Complex is the lack of pretense. The various structures shown in Taibbis articles shows a layer of bureacrats pretending not to be censors. Trump does away with that in favour of direct contact with the tech oligarchs. Supporters of Trump will no doubt say that when private companies suppresses speach it isn’t censorship, just as supporters of Biden have claimed that the above bureacrats merely helped with moderation. In reality, I think most can see that it isn’t the form, it is the content, that matters. And in content it is censorship whether it is bureacrats or oligarchs the will of the state flows through. the answer to that kind of bs is, as always, to speak the forbidden words anyways.\nso FREE PALESTINE.\noverwhelm them with violations.\nzionism=newnazis.\nukraine=oldnaziremnats.\nand so on.\nlike that fat dude that trump likes sez, “flood the zone”. but i am a First Amendment Absolutist…i believe it means what it says…and is pretty darned clear as such things go.\nive defended the kkk, back when…in a LTE…and was hated for it(i was already a folk devil and pariah anyway, and left for good soon after)\nFree Speech means free speech.\ni am free to speak my mind…and you are free to make use of the fainting couch.\ni might even bring you some iced tea.

As a former actuary and academic who worked for Paul Dieppe (author of a major, if not the main, rheumatology textbook for UK trainee docs circa 2000) this is very well known. The observed death rates compared to actuarial life expectancy among retired men who outlive their wives is horrifyingly high.  PS if you are puzzled by results centred on Iraq in a Google search of Paul then yes, it is that guy. PPS Amfortas pretty sure you’d live thru anything :) Your observations re combating social media compelled me to recount a recent observation. Up until about 3 weeks ago I had a reasonably acceptable relationship with YooToob. Most videos I watched were from accounts I follow (I am always logged in) and the algorithm suggested vids were often pretty interesting. Indeed I’ve been forced out of my comfort zone by some. BTW I also use a browser on Linux to ad and sponsor block so YT has learnt to give me minimal ads when I use my phone! Now the suggested videos are not just some “reasonably restricted” subset. They are definitely a set of 100 or so videos which just presents me with 16ish subset, just altering the subset upon every refresh. Believe me, I can spot this: “choice set construction” was my career for almost 20 years.  Something has changed fundamentally in the algorithm. I have to physically enter the kind of phrases you wrote to see videos from legit sources. The algorithm no longer puts the occasional gem into suggestions. YT has suddenly become practically unusable to me….unless I devote my long covid addled brain fogged cognition to actively search for stuff this site draws attention to. Worrying. I don’t think they’ve rolled this out globally but I strongly suspect they’re quietly piloting “changes” among subgroups who they know are most aware….. because if they can fool those of us who understand statistical design theory then what chance does the average Jo(e) stand? I hope you managed to get your steaming hot bath. I hate being lonely. My wife left for the city today, as she must do from time to time, and well… John Sebastian nailed it for me when he wrote, within his song “Darling Come Home Soon, “…for the great relief of having you to talk to.”\nI’ve got Renee Claude keeping me company on the turntable. From the lp Je reprends mon souffle, here is  Le Bonheur. Despite the West Wing and the damage it has wrought I don’t think I will ever lose my love for Annette Benning’s hair cut or Sorkin’s free speech description in The American President.   America isn’t easy. America is advanced citizenship. You gotta want it bad, ’cause it’s gonna put up a fight. It’s gonna say “You want free speech? Let’s see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who’s standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can’t just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then, you can stand up and sing about the “land of the free”. It may have taken the ACLU fighting for the right of Neo Nazi holocaust supporters to march through Skokie, but I finally got it. That’s why it is there. I hated it, but if they don’t have the right to be hateful asses at the top of their lungs, I don’t have the right to fight for what I believe in most strongly even being an ass about it. Unfortunately I no longer expect them or our politicians to fight for the first amendment. RE:  That’s a lot of PMC, especially in Northern Virginia and Maryland, suddenly uncertain of their employment prospects.

[Amanda Marcotte, Salon]. “Most people, if they made this gesture innocently, would be upset about the neo-Nazis trying to claim common cause with them. As Ed Kilgore argued at New York Tuesday, ‘there is an easy way to clear this up, particularly for someone who owns a major social-media platform and uses it very often.’ All Musk needs to do is ‘make the gesture of denouncing fascism aggressively.’ He adds that explicitly rejecting fascism and white nationalism ‘should be worth a few dozen tweets, wouldn’t you say?’”  How is this not extortion? [Not to mention flamebait] They’re literally saying, “Say something to this exact effect or we’ll say you’re a Nazi.” I’m pretty sure they’d be glad to give him a list of acceptable words to use. And no Afrikaans — that’s a racist language! He was already subjected to the Auschwitz with Ben Shapiro holiday package. If you have read any of Marcotte’s work, she’s been calling Trump and Musk Nazi’s for as long as I can remember, and will continue to do so no matter what they do. She helps feed the outrage machine that hates everything red and loves everything blue. She will be very busy for the next 4 years as the outrage machine is going full bore as we speak. Great work if you can get it I guess. There is an entire industry of them. I find them entertaining and hilarious. I mean really, all we can do is laugh at all the silliness they puke out each and every day.  You have the Morcotte types writing for Salon and others, the TV types like The View and a few others (Morning Joe?) and then independent media like Breaking Points with the unhinged Krystal Ball and her hubby Malibu Ken (Kyle Kulinski). None are worth watching or reading but they help keep the base riled up and misinformed, so they have a purpose. Plus, they are funny and entertaining for being so in your face awful. One of these people is not like the others: Krystal is an intelligent and well informed commentator who will debate issues on their merits.  It looked like a nazi salute to me. Musk is a spastic but the movement was very deliberate. Maybe he was trolling and he wants the freak out, but there’s a fine line between trolling fascist and being fascist.

People who commit assault should be punished, and I know that some of those convicted have already served their time and been released, so it isn’t like everybody got off scot free.   I’d guess some also wound up doing less time than they otherwise would have for actual crimes. One does wonder if all of these people would have been pardoned if Biden hadn’t given a blanket pardon to the J6 committee, which sure insinuated they had also committed crimes.  I guess we’ll never know.  But I’m so old I do remember a former speaker of the house mentioning that “elections have consequences”.  Of course in her case, she didn’t actually impose any consequences after making the claim, but this time someone did.  Quelle surprise! Turley weighs in – https://jonathanturley.org/2025/01/21/the-end-of-shock-and-awe-how-the-justice-department-against-the-case-for-the-j6-pardons/ “Four years ago, the Justice Department set out to send a chilling message to the nation. In an interview with CBS News a year later, Justice Department official Michael Sherwin indicated that they wanted to send a message with the harsh treatment of defendants. Sherwin explained that “our office wanted to ensure that there was shock and awe … it worked because we saw through media posts that people were afraid to come back to D.C. because they’re, like, ‘If we go there, we’re gonna get charged.’ … We wanted to take out those individuals that essentially were thumbing their noses at the public for what they did.” ” So right back at ya with the shock and awe, huh Republicans?  That’s what you get for overreaching in the first place. I think that a blanket pardon was the only way for Trump to go. If he had gone over each case individually to see who should have been released and who was actually violent, the DoJ would have slow-walked the whole process out of spite and it would take 10 years to sort out those 1500 people. And the media would have been disputing each and every single release as to who was “worthy’. This way, Trump short-circuited the whole thing and let them all go at once and by next week the media would have forgotten the whole thing. RE: They [MAGAs] think [Musk] is trying to subvert the ethno-cultural revival of the American nation state, spreading money around to capture the Trump movement for his own purposes.

In case you have been following the “it’s all about aggressive masculinity” line bruited about these days to explain the in-coming Trump administration and its many hangers-on. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have “hugged it out” and resolved their differences, after Dimon’s bank sued the tech billionaire’s electric vehicle firm in 2021… Oh. Huggies among the oppressor class. I’m deeply moved. I detect something else at play: Power. I would also remind you of this morning’s post from Politico about the execrable Elise Stefanik. To quote.  “We need to have strong American leadership working with our allies to push back on this,” Stefanik said. “China has made inroads in placing CCP leaders and Chinese diplomats in positions as heads of various sub-U.N. agencies, but also at the most junior level,” she added, using the acronym for the Chinese Communist Party. Stefanik said she’d strive to increase the number of U.S. citizens working within the United Nations system and work with colleges and universities to recruit early-career professionals to that end, calling it a “human capital strategy” to combat China. She’s crazy. I recall her tantruming in the Congress about so-called antisemitism at Harvard.  It’s scoundrel time. And it turns out that being a scoundrel is, errrr, nonbinary. > “it’s all about aggressive masculinity” Joe Biden being Exhibit A, if that’s your theory…. Hillary Clinton and Mad Maddie Albright as exhibits B and C. I have added orts and scraps (especially Melania’s hat). They are scattered throughout, so you might need to start at the top and work your way down…. On Twitter some were calling that the V for Vendetta hat. Might be on to something. My initial reaction to the hat was that it reminded me very much of the hat Lee Van Cleef (“The Bad”) wore in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. That’s another one. Bravo. On that note – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I always liked the music from that movie. I’m a music fan, have the talent of a brick, but really only listen to classic rock (I’m old). I don’t know who did the original soundtrack, but you can find clones on YouTube. One from the The Danish National Symphony Orchestra.  I find it amazing how they synchronize and choreographs it all. Right down to a guy tapping a chime of some type, then muting it. Even a couple playing rock and roll type guitars. They just nail it. The Good, Bad, and the Ugly music  Ask and ye shall receive- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly_(soundtrack) But man, that guy really nailed it with that soundtrack. There is nothing like it anywhere. Thank you, and yes. That was great! – never seen it performed by an orchestra before. Ennio Morricone is the guy who composed the songs for the movie.  He just died fairly recently and he was prolific – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Ennio_Morricone Well, you indeed are intrigued by Melania Trump’s hat.  I find all of the fussing among liberals to be louche. On the one hand, it’s a hat. On the other hand, after years of blabbing about “gaze” and women’s public image and projecting power, when Melania Trump lets loose and shows herself as much more independent-minded than people expect, we get sniping. I’m not saying that Melania is Rosa Luxemburg, but I think that she gets an A for effort. And I will raise the stakes with some hats and gaze and public image: Sofonisba Anguissola paints her mom (yep, mamma):\nhttps://www.wikiart.org/en/sofonisba-anguissola/portrait-of-bianca-ponzoni-anguissola-the-artist-s-mother-1557 Sofonisba Anguissola paints a member of the Savoy family (hat, gaze, and image, indeed):\nhttps://thehistoryofpaintingrevisited.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/7/0/25704469/7917943_2_orig.jpg The esteemed Rosalba Carriera paints the painter Felicita Sartori in Turkish garb:\nhttps://eriarte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rosalba-Carriera-Ritratto-Felicita-Sartori-con-vestito-turco.jpeg I’m not saying that Melania is Rosa Luxemburg, but I think that she gets an A for effort. The juxtaposition of those two concepts is really funny. It may have just been me – but I got a very 1980s vibe from Melania’s outfit and hat the other day.  Almost like she was trying to resurrect Lady Di who wore similar hats. Then of course, this classic 1980s look……I remember this artist from the Duran Duran album covers. https://www.teepublic.com/pin/55462305-classy-lady-80s-patrick-nagel Even the Jack Nicholson Joker character from 1989 got into that type of hat. Just not sure why the 1980s ambience.

The Brutalist: Dubbing the Hungarian. That’s what he did, dubbing.  Many, many Italian films use dubbing. In fact, some actors in Italy have been / are known for dubbing specific American actors. Oh, so-and-so dubbed Burt Lancaster. Lancaster’s famous performance as Prince Fabrizio in the Leopard is dubbed, even though he worked in Italy regularly. Fellini dubbed much dialogue in his films.  I don’t find much of an issue with dubbing.  An Italian Wiki article specifically about dubbing in Italy, listing dozens of actors who dubbed:\nhttps://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storia_del_doppiaggio_italiano A map. Both Italy and Hungary use dubbing extensively. (Some controversies in the notes about extent in other countries.)\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dubbing_films_in_Europe.png The article seems like more of a symptom of how little Americans know of the complications of getting one’s film made and shown on a content with dozens of languages. I don’t mind the dubbing. Just hire a human. yeah. i mean, under the capitalist fantasy, arent we suppose to sing for our supper?\nfunny how all these techlords never say a word about how  the full spectrum luxury communism(ie:star trek, Picard Era) was supposed to mitigate the downsides of their Gee Whizz.\non the current track, theyll get us…instead…Terminator…then, hopefully,a Butlerian Jihad…and hopefully not the world of the Matrix. when they roll out Replicators for free, i’ll believe in them.\nuntil that time, i will consider them enemies of mankind…as well as potential dinner. There are people hired to “dub” those things and they are actors. In fact many times they are the same actor as the one you see on screen. Practically since talkies began, they have had to re-record dialogue for numerous reasons, most often because for whatever reason the sound in one or more scenes  from the filming just isn’t good. And really good voice actors work all the time because whether it is animation or recording the translated version of a foreign film, you need good actors doing it. I have no doubt that Fellini would be appalled at the idea of AI dubbing the dialogue in his films. Even narration needs a skilled human.\nUsing AI to do the dialogue might be interesting for a minute or two, but just like the AI generated you tubes there comes that moment when you know it isn’t real. “I wouldn’t have picked it as a Picasso, nor as by a 15-year-old…” Me, neither, at least with regard to the 15-year-old part, since I think Sci­ence and Char­i­ty was painted by a 16-year-old Pablo Picasso. With regard to a teenage Picasso, I think of First Communion, which he painted a year earlier, when he was (not surprisingly) 15. He entered that work in the Exposicion de Bellas Artes in Madrid, where it earned an honorable mention. And, just after this time, Picasso began skipping classes at the Academia Real de San Fernando, bored with the formalist strictures adhered to there. (Probably he felt that the school had nothing of value to teach him.) His uncle, who had been his main financial backer, cut him off without so much as a peseta, forcing Picasso to live on whatever meager assistance his father could provide, before he (Picasso, not his dad) dropped out entirely. The most interesting aspect of Picasso’s mature paintings, imo, is the way he seemed to try to make the image itself move within the painting.  You know, a profile image  combined with full face image, as if you saw a face turning toward you and back again.  Until then, until cubism, movement in a painting was movement of the viewer’s eyes through or across the painting.  Then came cubism: To see many sides at once. To make an image implying the movement of the painting’s subject itself within the painting was unknown.  / my 2 cents. it took shrooms for me to see what you’re talking about…but it was a frenetic time, for me, when i had access to such things.\nnow, in my decrepit dotage, i definitely get it. Ever see this one from your fellow Texan? – https://laughingsquid.com/shaking-man-by-terry-allen/ Another favorite of mine from Allen, although not Picasso-esque – Corporate Head – https://www.tiktok.com/@latimes/video/7420948436414958879 shaking man hangs out on the corner of huebner and fredricksburg roads in san antonio, texas.\nhe yells and curses, with great force, and gestures with even greater force…at imaginary people.\nwho arent really there.\nnow that i talk to myself,as well as to my dead wife…. out loud, all the fucking time…i think of that guy alot. That’s a really interesting comment (as your comments invariably are). We might see that motion really clearly in Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2) by Marcel Duchamp, who himself said the painting was an exercise in addressing ““the problem of motion in painting.” (Was it cubist or, really, futurist?) It’s kind of like those stroboscopic photographic images. “To make an image implying the movement of the painting’s subject itself within the painting was unknown [until cubism].” Well, maybe not entirely unknown. See, for example, the “[f]ive stag heads in the Nave region of Lascaux cave [which] might represent a single stag in different stages of motion.” But that was, like, 17,000–22,000 years ago—and the Lascaux cave painting weren’t discovered till 1940—so maybe unknown to painters of the late 19th-early 20th century. Then again, I certainly don’t claim to be any sort of art maven. When Picasso went to visit the Lascaux caves he came out saying ‘We have learned nothing in 12,000 years’– https://spiritofthesenses.wordpress.com/2023/03/01/lost-in-translation/ “When Picasso went to visit the Lascaux caves…” There is no record of such a visit, and such supposed words would make no sense coming from Picasso.  But, about seeing, what have we learned to see in 12,000 years is a terrific question to ask ourselves.  The question was asked by the superb EH Gombrich in “Art and Illusion.” I will add to this muddled comment, after thinking. you remain a jewel, CA. https://www.nytimes.com/1960/04/03/archives/image-and-idea-art-and-illusion-a-study-in-the-psychology-of.html April 3, 1960 Image And Idea\nBy Alfred Frankenstein ART AND ILLUSION:\nA Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation.\nBy E.H.

Re: Birthright citizenship. I’m not a lawyer, but I am a historian by background, so here’s my view:  We should consider not only the plain language of the 14th Amendment (“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”); we must also consider, prior to that, the overwhelming weight of precedent. Even if the 14th Amendment didn’t exist, the EO would still be basically contrary to the common law here.  See the following: I. “Nothing is better settled at the common law than the doctrine that the children even of aliens born in a country, while the parents are resident there under the protection of the government, and owing a temporary allegiance thereto, are subjects by birth.”\n— Justice Joseph Story, concurring opinion in _Inglis v. _Trustees of the Sailor’s Snug Harbour in the City of New York_ (1830), 28 U.S. 99.

In that case, Lord Coke wrote: “yet it was resolved, that all that were born under one natural obedience while the realms were united under one sovereign, should remain natural born subjects, and no aliens; for that naturalization due and bested by birthright, cannot bby any separation of the Crowns afterward be taken away: nor he that was by judgment a natural subject at the time of his birth, become an alien by such a matter ex post facto.” (Calvin’s Case, 409. http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1572/64.pdf) Considered together, I would argue that it becomes clear that no mere executive order, which necessarily is limited to the Executive Branch under Art. II of the U.S. Constitution, is competent in a constitutional sense to undo either an actual amendment to the constitution, or, even prior to that, to extinguish rights which have for many centuries inhered in the Common Law.

I’m very curious to see the outcome of the suit recently filed in Concord, N.H., by the ACLU. Apologies to all for the duplicate comments. No apologies necessary.  Very interesting and timely comment. So when Americans have a child in France does that make it a French citizen? Just asking. Your interpretation has been established by subsequent court rulings but the “under the jurisdiction” is somewhat ambiguous as to its meaning. Thanks, flora, I appreciate that, and thank you Carolinian for the question.  My non-lawyer’s understanding is that there are two aspects of citizenship under question — jus soli and jus sanguinis (right of the soil and right of the blood). Both are present in our legal system, but jus soli occurs in the common law itself per Justice Story. Jus sanguinis exists via statute, in our cases, American naturalization law extending back to the first Naturalization Act of 1790 (1st Stat. 103) and successor legislation. This establishes that the children of Americans born abroad (generally) are US citizens. There is also English precedent here, De natis ultra mare, 25 Edw. 3 Stat. 1. (1350), A Statute for those who are born in Parts beyond Sea. My understanding is that this was a statute relating to the children of English soldiers born in France during the Hundred Years War, and whether or not they could inherit property in England. John McCain was born in Panama so that made him technically American enough to run for President. And he wasn’t even given American citizenship itself until he was 11 months old. You are referencing the American area of the old Panama Canal Zone.  A very dear, much older friend of mine was born in the US Panama Canal Zone some 80+ years ago, and her US citizenship was  never questioned. I always thought the Canal Zone was considered US territory until Carter admin gave it back to Panama, at least? (And even then, US military installations abroad are generally considered American soil, except Guantanamo, where US Constitution does not apply.( Non-lawyer here, but the exact language is “…subject to the jurisdiction….” In etymology and common usage this means “subject to the dictates of the laws.” So the Constitutional Amendment does not apply to anyone who is not subject to the laws of the U.S., such as American-born children of foreign diplomats who have diplomatic immunity and are not subject to U.S. laws. However, it does seem to apply to “undocumented persons”/”illegal aliens” who can be arrested in the U.S. for burglary or murder or ticketed for exceeding the speed limit while driving an automobile. They are subject to the dictates of U.S. and state laws, therefore they are “…subject to the jurisdiction….” However, since all words are bent and controlled at will by the PTB, who knows? We may see further Orwellian destruction of the true meaning of words. As for other countries, they are free to make their own laws concerning citizenship. I know of two examples. A person born to two U.S. parents in post-WWII Germany could claim German citizenship before the age of 18. In Ireland, under current rules, my mother could have claimed Irish citizenship before her 18th birthday because she had a natural-born Irish grandparent. As a great-grandchild of an Irish citizen, I have no special rights to Irish citizenship. This is very well stated, thank you. As a child born to US graduate students at a German University, in a German hospital, I was never eligible for German Citizenship.  Children born in Germany in 1983 and later are eligible for citizenship, but not before.  I was born in 1982, and it was never an option, I looked into it. At the very least “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” would exclude diplomats’ children, since they have diplomatic immunity. Furthermore, “owing a temporary allegiance thereto” would not include tourists or illegal immigrants — neither owe any allegiance to the US merely by their presence. I think that “owing a temporary allegiance to” flows from being “under the protection of.” It is not legal to break the laws of our country to abuse or harm a tourist or immigrant.  They are persons subject to and protected by the laws of the jurisdiction they are visiting or inhabiting. They are under the protection of our laws, and do indeed, de facto, owe temporary or permanent allegiance to laws and hence the system of governance that determines and enforces those laws. This is not an emotional allegiance, but a legal one. It’s a legal allegiance, not an emotional one JustTheFacts, on the first point — yes, and inasmuch as “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is one of the phrases on which the EO turns, it’s important to note that if aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, then the United States cannot enter proceedings against them.  At the same time, the new Administration is very likely to sign the Laken Riley Act in the very near future, which would instruct ICE to detain aliens who have been charged, arrested for, or convicted of certain crimes.  But if the US has no jurisdiction over these individuals, then the Laken Riley Act is null, since the US would have no authority to enter into any kind of proceedings with respect to these individuals. Both of these things — the US not having jurisdiction and the US having jurisdiction over these aliens — cannot be true at the same time. On the second point, I am not sure I see the basis for the argument that tourists and illegal aliens do not owe “a temporary allegiance” to the US. “Allegiance” here in my view would simply signify that tourists or aliens have to an affirmative duty to obey the law in the place where they are visiting or illegally staying. It doesn’t mean they have a sense of national belonging or loyalty to such a place, I would say. It’s also important to note Blackstone here, who supports Justice Story’s view of the matter. Blackstone writes in Book IV, Ch. 14 of the Commentaries on the Laws of England: “Therefore to kill an alien, a Jew, or an outlaw, who are all under the king’s peace or protection, is as much murder as to kill the most regular born Englishman; except he be an alien enemy, in time of war.”    In other words, aliens are, despite existing outside the national community, are still under the King’s Peace — or, the King’s jurisdiction. (The Crown having been replaced by the several States and the United States here. See Martin v. Waddell.) Swamp Yankee, thanks for your answer. It brings up another question: I’m curious how slaves would fit into this interpretation of allegiance, since it predates the 14th amendment (and therefore occurred during slavery)? They were born in the Colonies/States/US, but were not citizens, yet were subject to laws that would punish them if they killed someone. To be logically consistent, it seems to me that they would have had to be claimed not to have allegiance to the Crown… JustTheFacts,   Insofar as slaves go, slaves were explicitly not legal persons until the Reconstruction Amendments (13, 14, and 15) undid the legal infrastructure of slavery. Because of their legal status as property, there was no question of their allegiance one way or another (this was established in most cases by various colonial slave codes, this status as property in a legal sense). For this reason, slaves did not enjoy the protection of the laws (beyond that extended to property). Page 2890 of the Congressional Globe reports what the person who wrote the 14th amendment says it means: “This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already, that every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of embassadors (sic) or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United States” That’s certainly an interesting citation, and I appreciate it, but I don’t think it’s dispositive. For example, if you read the debate cited, the Senators from California do not take Sen. Howard’s view of it. They take it to mean exactly what it says, and, being terrified of Chinese migration, are concerned about its implications. Sen. Howard’s contention above all seems to me to be an attempt to prevail in a legislative debate. Moreover, it is really not the central issue, since the judicial branch interprets the law, and Justice Horace Gray’s opinion in United States v. Wong Kim Ark 169 US 649 – Supreme Court 1898, 654-55: “The Constitution nowhere defines the meaning of these words, either by way of inclusion or of exclusion, except in so far as this is done by the affirmative declaration that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light of the common law, the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution. Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162; Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417, 422; Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 624, 625; Smith v. Alabama, 124 U.S. 465. The language of the Constitution, as has been well said, could not be understood without reference to the common law. 1 Kent Com. 336; Bradley, J., in Moore v. United States, 91 U.S. 270, 274. In Minor v. Happersett, Chief Justice Waite, when construing, in behalf of the court, the very provision of the Fourteenth Amendment now in question, said: “The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that.” And he proceeded to resort to the common law as an aid in the construction of this provision. 21 Wall. 167.” Significantly, today the district court judge in the Western District of Washington decided to grant plaintiffs including the State of Washington a temporary restraining order enjoining Donald Trump et al. from enforcing sections of the recent Executive Order.

Great stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bktuEflhNU RE: “Donald Trump’s Medicare Executive Order Explained”\nI did not understand this ‘explanation’. What has the Bidden executive order that Trump rescinded with his executive order accomplished so far? It seems Bidden had started three ‘models’ for lowering drug prices in design or under study but were there any accomplishments to report? Working on new models sounds to me too much like sending the issues to be studied by committee. Don’t most countries of the world have working ‘models’ for lowering drug prices?  Reciting the Democratic National Committee director Alex Floyd’s claim that “Donald Trump is already following through on his dangerous plans to jack up the costs of drugs to appease his billionaire backers after the Biden-Harris administration took on Big Pharma and won.” impresses me as more cheesy than informative. And “…the Biden-Harris administration took on Big Pharma and won.” Give me break! Re: Ellison of Oracle last evening. I have the “privilege” of using the AI from his company or similar companies on a daily basis.  The level of errors is just through the roof.  I have to proofread so carefully that it really is not a time saver at all.  The care suggestions it comes up with which I have to address and deny are just comical most of the time.  Most importantly, it hallucinates just absolutely crazy stuff on almost every other patient.  As in out of the blue stuff that was never even discussed in the visits. And they want me to trust this AI technology to be fused with an mRNA platform and be injected into a patient’s body?  I mean, seriously?  What will happen to the poor soul when oops it hallucinated a whole sequence of extraneous DNA code.  He even said himself last night that these codes were gigabytes in length – who is going to proofread that.  These people and their hare-brained schemes literally terrify me. Interestingly, based on what I heard in the doctor’s lounge today – you can Cliffs Note the MD take in the following way – “we won’t be fooled again”. Hallucinates = makes stuff up based on unaccountable, mathematical, tokenized equations.  What could go wrong? Where “unaccountable” means you can’t see the algo. Thanks for this. I’m a computer/engineering type guy and it concerns me what this profession might have to deal with. I don’t like it one bit. There is a difference between a machine, say a robot floor sweeper learning your homes x,y coordinates, and it thinking and making decisions on it’s own (to put it in the simplest form I guess). I remember DOS, Windows… A friend was disputing my belief that one of the best things that could happen would be for all AI programs to become infected and to catastrophically and irreparably crash. She was trying to come up with something and got that they read EKGs. I told her about trying to find a very old video where I was reliably informed by AI that Glenn Close had never performed at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Funny thing about that, I was there when she did “One Brick at a Time” along with the cast of Barnum. And I said when they can’t get something that simple right, why would I want them interpreting my EKG. She had to admit that hers scared her until the doctor told her to ignore it. She took it that it saw too much. I took it that it made things up. But even she had to admit if it needed to be ignored it wasn’t useful. The pyjama pants and fluffy slippers look is a “thing” here in the North American Deep South. I have personally seen persons of both sexes thus attired at W—M—, Winn Dixie, the local Whole Foods clone, the Post Office, two Vitamin shops, several thrift stores, Target, and other places more obscure.\nAdd to this the truly amazing displays of female secondary sexual characteristics, (“packaged” in tight fitting items of several types,) and we see a culture firmly “on the skids.”\nI’m not advocating for strict dress codes, but the concept of public decency seems to have become null and void. Heh. It kinda recalls Jeff Bridges as “The Dude” shuffling through a supermarket in a bathrobe. Hey!\ndont knock it til ya try it!\nive worn a bathrobe to the store on many occasions.\n(and many peopl quote the big lebowski at me) and i dont have an issue, necessarily, with so-called slutty dress.\ni consider it an expression, and therefore a speech issue.\nwhat it is NOT, is an invitation. were we a civilised nation this would be widespread obvious…and i would be on disability.\nbut we are not a civilisation, sadly.\nwe’re a loose collection of mafias and gangs and cartels.\nan Hobbseian state of nature.\nagain, well done!

I often wear winter pajama pants as outerwear because paired with a light under layer or tights they work for me in all but the coldest nyc weather.

No slippers though I do have sheepskin boots.\nAnd I am now old enough I don’t care about the norms. “My struggle with doom scrolling” – [All That Jazz]. What tips do they have for the “denial scrolling”? And why is the dude in the middle wearning slippers and what looks like pajamas?, He’s cool. There’s more to see. Both the wristwatch on the left and the shoes on the right appear to cost more than an average month’s rent. Say what you will about that guy’s fashion sense, if he had been invited to Trump’s Inauguration he would have worn a business suit for sure and would never, ever have worn baggy shorts and a hoodie like Fetterman did there. I just feel bad for Fetterman. He’s not his past self. That he was “allowed” (wife, staff, where were you?) speaks volumes about his role. It’s close to abuse. I am no medical professional, but the nervous breakdown soon after starting his job in DC, and then the personality change after seem to be related. He must have some AOC-sized compromat. I had to look that up. It was pretty funny. I agree he sticks out like a sore thumb, but I think formal dress codes are pretty ridiculous to begin with, so I admit to enjoying the juxtaposition. It seems to have met with a positive response in some quarters – clearly not among any of the appalled elites in attendance, but then they’re not his constituency. He is a bit like Zelensky as when the later is going to a formal occasion, he puts on a black sweat shirt instead of a green one.

The Treatment : Covid summary post didn’t seem to make sense – 288 deaths for Azvudine vs 188 for Paxlovid and Az was better? The group sizes from the report were omitted – 6943 for Az and 1202 for Pax, so death rates were 4.15% for Az and 15.05% for Pax. Seems like a pretty significant difference.

Find out how you can still connect with us.\t\t\t Health Canada has issued a recall notice for compounded drugs containing semaglutide, which is a key component in popular medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. The notice was issued on Tuesday after a voluntary recall by Alberta-based Create Compounding Pharmacy, which compounded the drugs. The recalled drugs comprised semaglutide, which belongs to the GLP-1 class of drugs, and pyridoxine, which is a form of vitamin B6. “The product was produced with an unauthorized active pharmaceutical ingredient,” Health Canada said in the recall notice published Tuesday. The drugs were sold in syringe or vial form. Compounding is when pharmacies or other practitioners have the substances needed to mix and prepare specialty medications, and do so. It was frequently used in Canada by pharmacies during the COVID-19 pandemic when manufactured supplies of children’s pain medications were in short supply but the pharmaceutical components to mix those medications were still available in some pharmacies. It is only meant to be done in cases where there is limited supply of a medication “and should not be done solely for economic reasons for the healthcare professionals,” according to Health Canada guidelines on compounding. Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk says it’s the only company in Canada with Health Canada-approved products containing semaglutide. Novo Nordisk told Global News last summer that it had filed a complaint with Health Canada regarding the promotion and sale of compounded semaglutide. “We are aware that several compounding pharmacies, weight loss clinics, and medical spas are purporting to sell or offer unapproved compounded semaglutide products both in Canada and the U.S.,” a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk Canada said in an emailed statement in July 2024. Health Canada is advising patients to consult their doctor before stopping the use of the recalled drugs or for any health concerns. Consumers should also contact the company if they have any questions about the recall, the agency said. Any side effects can be reported to Health Canada. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert warning doctors and patients about dosing errors involving compounded semaglutide injectable products that were dispensed in multiple-dose vials. The health regulator said it had received reports of adverse events, with some requiring hospitalization, that may be related to overdoses due to patients incorrectly self-administering the compounded drug and health-care providers miscalculating doses. Because of the dosing errors, patients mistakenly took five to 20 times more than the intended dose, the FDA said. The Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Global News at the time that the FDA alert does not relate to the company’s products, Ozempic or Wegovy, but pertains to compounded semaglutide products, which are not approved in Canada nor the U.S. Among the adverse events reported in the U.S., some patients experienced nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fainting, headache, migraine, dehydration, acute pancreatitis and gallstones. Semaglutide works by helping control blood sugar levels and triggering a feeling of fullness. In recent years, Canada, like other countries, has seen a high demand for medications like Ozempic, which is primarily approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes but has been used off-label for weight loss. Wegovy, an on-label weight loss medication containing the same drug as Ozempic but at a higher formulation and made by the same manufacturer, also became available to Canadians last year. –with files from Reuters  The latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.

        "url": "https://slate.com/business/2025/01/homelessness-america-increase-affordable-housing-solutions-encampments-shelters.html",
        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Last Thursday, Cornelius Taylor was killed by an Atlanta city bulldozer. Taylor was homeless; the city’s Department of Public Works swept him up with the encampment where he slept. Taylor’s death is a tragedy. It’s also emblematic of the increasingly tense disputes over how to handle street homelessness in American communities. If the old canard about mayors is that the job is to shovel snow, pick up trash, and fill potholes, surely in 2025 we can add one more responsibility to the mix: managing the country’s increasingly visible crisis of affordable housing. The question of how to house the homeless, and in particular those who live on the street, has become a top issue in local politics just about everywhere. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s point-in-time count recorded an unprecedented second-straight double-digit increase in homelessness last year, taking the U.S. homeless population up 18 percent to an all-time high. At a time of low trust in institutions, this pervasive public suffering suggests a deep failure of government—and, especially, Democratic-run cities and states—to respond to society’s most pressing problems. Well before Donald Trump took office, the country was pivoting to a more punitive approach. A COVID-era wave of federal funding is drying up. The Supreme Court ruling in Grants Pass has paved the way for fines and jail time for people who sleep on the street. Liberal cities like New York and San Francisco are increasingly supportive of forced medical treatment as a response to public displays of mental illness. The consensus around Housing First strategies—which elevate proper housing as the precursor to other behavioral changes—is fraying as liberals grow desperate and conservatives draft their own policy responses to a problem that hasn’t traditionally concerned them. Politicians of all persuasions are trying to remove homeless encampments from public spaces, despite the concerns that “sweeps” without alternative solutions are dangerous and disruptive to those trying to rebuild their lives. Meanwhile, the root cause of homelessness, the lack of affordable housing, remains stubbornly difficult to fix. “There was growing bipartisan consensus that supportive housing and Housing First were strategies that reduced the human costs and fiscal costs,” said Shaun Donovan, the former HUD secretary and the head of the affordable-housing group Enterprise Community Partners. “I’m deeply concerned that alignment is fracturing. Grants Pass is a symbol of that, and an accelerant. … What you’re seeing is that mayors and others are losing patience and looking for solutions that are faster, like temporary housing and tiny homes, but also camping bans and criminalization, even if they are not solutions but actually make the problem worse.” It’s not hard to see why, he admits: We have spent years putting money and effort into solving this issue, and it can seem as if we have nothing to show for it. But that, many advocates say, would be a devastating misinterpretation. On the contrary: An enormous outlay of money during the pandemic did make a difference, and many who are homeless still find housing every year. But a new, larger wave of homeless people is taking their place in the shelters and on the streets. Take Atlanta: In 2021 federal stimulus money helped reduce homelessness by 40 percent. Since then, the number has crept back up each year, and a series of fires started by people living under bridges has prompted the city to take a more aggressive approach to those sleeping in public. Critics are right that the encampments are dangerous, mostly for those who live in them. But when they are bulldozed, their inhabitants lose touch with friends, documents, caseworkers, and public services. The most important factor driving this historic homelessness spike, experts say, is that the high cost of housing is no longer being abated by pandemic-era relief. Houston has seen a decrease in homelessness of 60 percent since 2011 and 17 percent since 2020, making it a national model. But local advocates are sounding the alarm that progress could quickly be reversed without more federal aid. Kelly Young, the president of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County, said in an email that the region needs a permanent revenue stream: “Without secure, long-term funding, there is a real risk of backsliding and increased pressure on shelters and services.” It’s not the only jurisdiction that has been flush with federal dollars to fight homelessness. Springfield, Missouri, is using American Rescue Plan money to build homeless shelters. Baltimore is building supportive housing. Massachusetts is fighting veteran homelessness. The result has been a supercharged version of the Community Development Block Grant program, the usual way HUD distributes money to cities for such projects. Even more significant, though, was the $46 billion federal rental-relief program, which kept vulnerable tenants in place during the pandemic. After that money was spent, housing insecurity came roaring back. The migrant surge of 2022–23 also affected the increase in certain cities, but experts say the problem ultimately ties back to housing-market fundamentals. “We are facing a cliff here in Connecticut,” said David Rich, of the state’s Housing Collective. “We thought we were bending the curve, but we’ve had a 40 percent increase [in homelessness] in Fairfield County over the past three years. The biggest impact has been rents increasing by 30 to 60 percent throughout western Connecticut. The vacancy rate is down, it’s practically impossible to find housing for the homeless, and there’s no throughput in the shelters.” Building more housing is the obvious solution, but many suburban towns will not hear of it. Though people sleeping in tents, in cars, and under blankets make up just a small part of the larger homeless population, they furnish the public’s primary sense of the problem—both the political urgency to help and the frustration when those efforts don’t succeed. In Los Angeles, for example, Mayor Karen Bass made it a priority to give people in encampments precedence for housing, upending a long-standing ranking system in favor of resolving the most high-profile cases. Unsheltered homelessness fell by 10 percent in two years, though the number of people “rough sleeping” without a tent or a vehicle has risen. In November, L.A. County voters once again decided to dedicate $1 billion a year in sales-tax money to building housing for homeless citizens. “The most amazing thing is that the population of Los Angeles is interested in solving this problem in a humane way,” said Louis Abramson, an advocate and researcher. “It’s a political miracle. It would be easy for them to feel neglected, swindled, underdelivered to.” (Previous efforts to build homeless housing have been slow and expensive.) By other measures, though, the goodwill is fading fast. California voters also adopted Prop. 36, a retail-industry initiative to impose harsher penalties for theft and drug use. After the Grants Pass ruling freed cities to penalize people sleeping in public, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told the state’s cities and towns to clear homeless encampments or lose funding. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry is clearing encampments in New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl. Public health researchers believe that the tactic is counterproductive to getting people back on their feet and increases the likelihood that someone will die on the streets. You might expect the ruling to divide cities and suburbs between those that prosecute homeless populations and those that do not. But that hasn’t been the case so far, perhaps because homeless people don’t typically “shop” between jurisdictions, as conservatives allege. Many live on the street not far from where they last lived under a roof. In Grants Pass itself, the Oregon city of 40,000 whose policy won the high court’s approval last summer, there is one city-sanctioned lot where homeless residents can sleep, though the city closes it at 7 every morning. Conservatives have formalized these policies at the state level. The Cicero Institute, a right-wing think tank founded by tech billionaire Joe Lonsdale, has guided states like Georgia to develop a conservative homelessness policy whose central points include statewide camping bans and a rejection of Housing First. Cicero argues that the housing delivery system is too expensive and that “states should pursue minimally viable shelter options and sanctioned encampments with services.” The view is shared by the America First PAC, the Trumpist policy plank. The third piece of the Cicero platform is to expand civil commitment laws, which permit the involuntary hospitalization or institutionalization of people with mental illnesses. Long a flash point of intra-left tension and reliably opposed by the ACLU, such laws are rapidly gaining ground in blue America as well. In New York, several left-wing candidates for this year’s mayoral election have endorsed the idea, following a series of violent crimes committed by and against homeless residents. Such measures are popular, but they’re hard to put into practice. When does the public’s discomfort in a park or a subway train become grounds for police to hold someone down and inject them with antipsychotic drugs? In many cases, as the sociologist Alex Barnard notes in his book Conservatorship, the barriers to providing effective mental health treatment lie upstream, in shortages of money, beds, and trained staff. Another sign of exasperation: Starbucks, long the default public bathroom for American cities, will close its restrooms to nonpaying customers in an attempt to deter homeless populations. It’s a problem we know how to solve: boatloads more affordable housing, with or without shared kitchens, in tiny homes or in single-room-occupancy or Low-Income Housing Tax Credit buildings, sometimes with built-in medical support. But the will to build this housing is lacking. For a case study, compare California’s all-hands-on-deck response to the homelessness created by the Los Angeles wildfires with the muted approach to the homelessness that came before. And so the urgency to manage the crisis manifests in short-term cycles through shelters, hospitals, and jails—rearranging the tents on the Titanic. It’s especially tragic, advocates say, on the heels of an experiment that showed that more money to keep people in housing could stop the homelessness crisis in its tracks. Donovan, the head of Enterprise Community Partners, says: “If you’re a company running a factory line and falling behind demand for your product, the answer is not that something’s wrong with the product or the factory. Instead, you need to speed up production or open new factories to meet the demand.” Rather, many people feel that the system is broken and want to try something new. This is in part because we have a distorted mental image of the crisis. The avatar of homelessness in the American mind is a person with mental illness and a drug problem who has lived outside for years. In reality, all those categories are minorities: Most homeless people live in shelters or housing. Fewer than 1 in 5 are severely mentally ill; fewer than 1 in 7 have addiction issues. Perhaps most importantly, fewer than 1 in 4 have been homeless for more than a year. Most have recently fallen on hard times. They have lost their place due to a layoff or a natural disaster or a rent increase or an abusive partner. They will be homeless, then they will be housed again. At a time when tens of thousands of Americans have just had their homes destroyed by fire and flood, is it so hard to imagine ourselves in their shoes? Patrick Fealey, a former Boston Globe reporter who lives in his car, wrote in Esquire this fall that the recognition is present but subconscious: “Many of you could be where we are—on the street—but for some simple and not uncommon twist of fate. This is part of your rejection, this fear that it could be you. You deny that reality because it is too horrific to contemplate, therefore you must deny us.” \n        Thanks for signing up!

research on SFTSV, the potential widespread threats pose a significant challenge for researchers in developing new treatment and prevention methods. In this present, we have developed a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine for SFTSV and valid it with in silico methods. We screened 9 immunodominant epitopes for cytotoxic T cells (CTL), 7 for helper T cells (HTL), and 8 for Linear B-cell (LBL) based on promising candidate protein Gn, Gc, Np, and NSs. All predicted epitopes demonstrated strong antigenicity without any potential harm to humans. Additionally, the high conservancy is required to cover different strains. All epitopes as well as adjuvants were constructed into a final vaccine, which was further assesd by calculating of physicochemical properties. Then, we docked the vaccine protein with immune receptors and analyzed the complexes with dynamic simulations to evaluate its affinity to receptors. Finally, the vaccine sequence was constructed into a mRNA sequence. The constructed vaccine is a potential candidate for combating SFTSV by stimulating protective humoral and cellular immune responses. As a common situation, when pathogens enter the body, antigenic proteins (such as virus proteins synthesized by infected cells) will be processed into short peptides, where those immunogenic peptides will bind to MHC molecules to form complexes, triggering immune processes. These short peptides are called epitopes, and on a larger antigenic protein, only a small number of epitopes actually function. Through the linkage of epitopes, multi-epitope subunit vaccines can be formed, which exhibit excellent properties and, at the same time, reduce the potential harm to the human body compared to natural protein vaccines. With the advancement of immunoinformatics technology, we can now predict unknown epitopes from proteins. Various studies have shown that this prediction has high accuracy and can be fully utilized in vaccine design. Based on this, when emerging pathogens such as SFTSV appear, we can significantly reduce the time required for vaccine design and validation.

Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Nowadays, the development of pathogen isolation and identification techniques has clarified the etiology of more diseases, and researchers have identified culprits for many diseases that lack specific symptoms. Since first reported in 2009, SFTSV has been widely distributed through East Asia [1–3]. It is emerging as an arthropod-borne infectious disease, causing a significant number of new cases every year, during the period of 2013 to 2016, 7419 cases in total were reported across China, among which 355 cases have been confirmed to be fatal [4]. Due to a lack of awareness, this data is underestimated, a large number of patients who have not undergone high-throughput sequencing are likely to be perceived as atypical cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Meanwhile, the lack of an adequate number of individual cases in each report leads to fluctuations in the estimated mortality rate, which varies between 2–48% in different studies. However, as the reports increase, the true mortality rate of SFTSV probably lies at 5%–10% and tends to increase significantly with age [5]. Just as the name of the virus describes, SFTSV lead to severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome, which usually presents with Liver function impairment and gastrointestinal symptoms, cytokine storms, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) caused by viral attack finally leads to multiple organ dysfunction [6]. SFTSV was first recognized as a tick-borne virus, as early reports all have a clear history of tick bites. However, subsequent reports indicate that SFTSV can be transmitted through fluid contact or even aerosols, and some cases of cluster infections within households or hospitals have emerged [7]. Simultaneously, cases of direct transmission of STFSV from animals to humans without tick vectors have also been reported [8]. In such an unsettling atmosphere, WHO ranked STFS the highest research priority in 2017, due to the potential risk of a pandemic. Despite the pathogenic process of SFTSV gradually become clear, how to treat and prevent it remains a challenge. Considering there is a general lack of specific immunity in the population, vaccine development is an important component in the prevention and control of SFTSV. According to phylogenetic analysis based on gene sequencing results, STFSV was classified into the Bunyavirales Phenuiviridae family, and assigned as species Dabie bandavirus in genus Bandavirus, precisely. Like other Bunyaviruses, SFTSV is a spherical virus packaging a single negative-stranded RNA, three mRNA segments were named L, M, and S based on their relative length [9]. L segment encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and participates in viral genetic informations’ transmission. While S encodes nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as nonstructural protein (NSs). Finally, as the segment with the highest level of self-replicating, M segment encodes the precursor of membrane protein (Gp), which will be modified into glycoprotein c(Gc) and glycoprotein n(Gn) later. In the proteome of STFSV, NP, NSs, Gc, and Gn are highly associated with the immune progress of STFSV. Gc and Gn form protein polymers on the envelope of STFSV and mediates virus invasion into target cells [10]. Considering the significant importance of Gc and Gn in viral life and the characteristics of providing main neutralizing epitopes and immunogenicity, they are currently the main target for antiviral intervention. Studies have revealed antibody titers of Gn and Gc are associated closely with patient survival [11]. Antibodies obtained from camels immunized with Gn can suppress SFTSV infection in mice [12]. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector-based Gc/Gn vaccine can induce strong neutralizing antibodies and protect mice from fatal SFTSV attack [13], similarly, another smallpox (LC16m8) vector-based Gc vaccine performed well in surviving mice and ferret models from fatal SFTSV infection [14]. Meanwhile, Kwak et al developed a series of DNA vaccines encoding Ns, NP, RdRp, Gc, and Gn separately, among which, only the Gc and Gn vaccine can generate neutralizing antibodies, but non-glycoproteins (Ns, Np, and RdRp) can still provide protection for ferret from fatal SFTSV infection, which is mainly achieved through the induction of specific T cell immunity [15]. Though there was a study that reported recombinant Ns has no effect on the clearance of SFTSV in mice [16], in doctor Kwak’s research, individual Ns DNA vaccine can provide partial protection, NP and RdRp also have the same effect [15]. Overall, the current research on SFTSV vaccines is still somewhat insufficient. MRNA is an ideal vaccine platform because of its unique advantages in improving efficacy, reducing development time, ensuring safety profile, and minimizing manufacturing cost [17]. MRNA vaccines carrying multiple epitopes can lead to activation of both humoral and cellular immune response. At this present, our team predicted conservative T and B cell epitopes from protective target proteins Gn, Gc, NP, and Ns, which are critical in virus invasion and replication. After sorting and selecting, an epitope-based mRNA vaccine was designed in the end, further prediction of the vaccine docking to immune receptors and dynamic validated the potential of the construction. Hopefully, this candidate vaccine can address potential pandemics of SFTSV. Gn, Gc, NP, and NSs of the SFTSV reference strain (GCA_003087855.1), HBMC strain, and HB29 strain were retrieved from the NCBI database, since HBMC and HB29 strains are common in China (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). NetCTL 1.2 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL-1.2/) predicted CTL epitopes with a threshold of 0.75. All 12 supertypes (A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58, B62) were selected for epitope prediction, peptide-MHCI binding, C-terminal cleavage of the proteasome and、 TAP transport efficiency were considered in this step [18]. Then, Vaxijen 2.0 predicted the antigenicity of epitopes, only epitopes with antigenicity >0.4 will be included in the next screening step [19]. AllerTOP 2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP) and ToxinPred 2.0 (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred2/) were used to predict the allergenicity and toxicity of the epitopes, only epitopes that are non-toxic and non-allergenic will be further screened [20,21]. To ensure the CTL epitopes has proper immunogenicity, the MHC I Immunogenicity tool from IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/) was used to predict the immunogenicity of the epitopes, only epitopes with an immunogenicity >0 will be selected [22]. Finally, the Tepitool tool from IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/tepitool/) used Consensus algorithm to predict the MHC I alleles that the epitopes can bind to, only epitopes with an IC50 < 500 nm will be included in the vaccine construction [23]. The NetMHCIIpan4.0 server (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-4.0/) was utilized for the prediction of HTL epitopes, by deploying NNAlign_MA algorithm, NetMHCIIpan can predict HTL epitopes base on combined methods of prediction algorithm training and the capability of annotating EL (eluted ligands) MA (Multi Allelic) sequences to single MHC restrictions [24]. A total of 26 commonly observed MHC II alleles (DRB1_0101, DRB1_0301, DRB1_0401, DRB1_0404, DRB1_0405, DRB1_0701, DRB1_0802, DRB1_0901, DRB1_1101, DRB1_1302, DRB1_1501, DRB3_0101, DRB4_0101, DRB5_0101, HLA-DQA10501-DQB10201, HLA-DQA10501-DQB10301, HLA-DQA10301-DQB10302, HLA-DQA10401-DQB10402, HLA-DQA10101-DQB10501, HLA-DQA10102-DQB10602, HLA-DPA10201-DPB10101, HLA-DPA10103-DPB10201, HLA-DPA10103-DPB10401, HLA-DPA10301-DPB10402, HLA-DPA10201-DPB10501, HLA-DPA10201-DPB11401) were chosen for the prediction of their corresponding epitopes. Epitopes possessing an IC50 value less than 500 nm were incorporated in the subsequent screening phase. Vaxijen2.0, Allertop 2.0, as well as ToxinPred 2.0 were employed to forecast epitopes’ antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity, respectively. Only epitopes displaying an antigenicity score above 0.4 while lacking toxicity or allergenicity could be introduced into the next step. IFNepitope (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ifnepitope/), IL2Pred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/il2pred/), and IL4Pred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/il4pred/) determined the potential of the epitopes to induce IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4, correspondingly [25,26]. The potential ability of inducing pro-inflammatory factors is important in HTL epitopes mediating the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T and B cells [27]. Subsequently, only epitopes that can stimulate the production of all three cytokines were selected. The ABCpred tool (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/abcpred/) was employed to predict linear B cell epitopes, utilizing a threshold value of 0.51, this algorithm is mainly based on standard feed-forward (FNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) [28]. The predicted length was determined to be 16 amino acids. Vaxijen2.0, Allertop 2.0, and ToxinPred 2.0 were checked the antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Subsequently, only epitopes exhibiting an antigenicity score exceeding 0.4, while remaining devoid of any toxicity or allergenicity, were selected for further screening. A total of 230 complete genomes of the SFTSV were downloaded from the NCBI database on November 20, 2022, which was used for the purpose of constructing a local comprehensive genome database. The local tblastn tool was proceeded to forecast the conservation of epitopes across the 230 SFTSV virus strains. Only epitopes exhibiting significant conservation or free from mutation sites were incorporated into the final vaccine assembly. Meanwhile, another blast was ran to ensure that there is no overlap between the epitopes and the human genome and the human gut microbiome genome to avoid potential harm. We downloaded the complete proteome of humans (Txid:9606) from the NCBI database as well as the complete proteome of 79 common intestinal bacterial species in the human body from the NCBI database [29]. Use the Diamond software to construct a local database and analyze the homology of epitopes with the human and intestinal bacterial proteomes using the BLASTp program. Epitopes with an E-value less than 0.00001 and a bit-score >100 are considered homologous to the human and intestinal bacterial proteomes. Ultimately, we obtained epitopes who has strong antigenicity and without toxicity or allergenicity to construct the vaccine. CTL epitopes are connected with AAY linkers, HTL epitopes are connected using the GPGPG linkers, and B-cell epitopes are connected with KK linkers. The β-defensin Ⅱ is attached to the N-termini of the vaccine along with the use of an EAAAK linker, who serves as an adjuvant enhancing the immunogenicity. And a TAT sequence is attached to the C-terminal with an EAAAK linker to assist the vaccine transfer across the cellular membrane. The Protparam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was utilized to predict the physicochemical properties of vaccines. Then, ToxinPred2.0 and AllerTOP 2.0 were employed to predict the toxicity and allergenicity of vaccines, while Vaixijen 2.0 and ANTIGENpro (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) were employed for the prediction of vaccine antigenicity [30]. PISPRED 4.0 (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) was employed to predict the secondary structure of vaccines with an accuracy rate exceeding 84%. The Robetta (https://robetta.bakerlab.org/) software was utilized for predicting the tertiary structure of vaccines. This software employs the RoseTTAfold method to predict the tertiary structure of proteins, yielding results that approach the accuracy of Deepmind [31]. To improve the overall quality of the model, the GalaxyRefine tool (https://www.bio.tools/galaxyrefine#!) refined and optimized the protein structure, selecting models with lower Molprobity scores for subsequent analysis [32]. Finally, the overall quality of the protein structure is validated using PROCHECK, ERRAT, and Prosa-Web tools (https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/) [33,34]. The visualization of vaccine structures is performed using PyMOL v2.5 software and Chimera v1.15 software. The antibody epitope prediction tool ElliPro (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) was utilized to predict potential conformational B cell epitopes in vaccine structures. ElliPro predicts discontinuous antibody epitopes by leveraging the three-dimensional structure of the antigenic protein and associates each predicted epitope with a corresponding protrusion index (PI) value [35]. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are essential for recognizing viral membrane proteins and initiating the innate immune response in the host. The HLA-A0201 and HLA-DRB1_0101 receptors are common MHC molecule receptors that are crucial for antigen presentation. The crystal structures of TLR2 (PDB ID: 2Z7X), TLR4 (PDB ID: 4G8A), HLA-A0201 (PDB ID: 4U6Y), and HLA-DRB1_0101 (PDB ID: 5V4N) were retrieved from the RCSB PDB database. The ClusPro 2.0 server (https://cluspro.org/help.php), a highly regarded server for predicting protein binding, was utilized for molecular docking of these molecules [36]. Then, the HADDOCK 2.4 server (https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/) was employed to refine and optimize the structures of protein complexes in a rational manner [37]. Finally, the PDBsum server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/) was utilized to analyze interactions between vaccines and receptors [38]. Molecular dynamics simulations proceeded to model the stability of vaccine-receptor complexes in aqueous solutions, thereby elucidating the binding stability between vaccines and receptors. The Gromacs v2022.1 software was employed to conduct 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations on all vaccine-receptor complexes with the Amber14SB force field. And the vaccine-receptor complexes were confined within a cubic box containing TIP3P water molecules. Na+ or Cl- ions were subsequently introduced to achieve overall system charge neutralization. Then, energy minimization was conducted to attain the protein complexes’ lowest energy state. The entire system was equilibrated at a temperature of 310 K (close to body temperature) through NVT (canonical ensemble) simulations for 200 ps. Following that, NPT (isothermal-isobaric ensemble) simulations were performed on the system at a pressure of 1 atm for 1 ns. Finally, the protein complex was subjected to a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation in an aqueous solution at 310 K and 1 atm using Gromacs. RMSD (root mean square deviation), RMSF (root mean square fluctuation), the number of hydrogen bonds, and Rg (gyration radius) were assessed based on the molecular dynamic simulation trajectory using Gromacs [39]. GMX_MMPBSA v1.56 was utilized for calculating the changes in binding energy between protein complexes in simulated trajectories. The MMPBSA method is used to assess the binding energies among protein molecules during the last 20 ns of the simulation, assuming the protein complex is in a stable state. The specific formula employed for the calculation is as follow: The frequencies of HLA alleles vary across different regions and populations. Thereby, the Population coverage tool of IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) calculates the global coverage of the vaccine based on the specific HLA molecules that correspond with various epitopes [40]. The C-IMMSIM server (https://kraken.iac.rm.cnr.it/C-IMMSIM/index.php?page=0) simulates the host’s immune response following three vaccine injections with a 4-week interval between each. By default, the HLA-A01:01, HLA-B07:02, and HLA-DRB1*01:01 allele gene molecules are chosen. Overall, the simulation lasts for a total of 350 days [41]. Jcat server (http://www.jcat.de/Start.jsp.) was utilized for reverse translation and optimization of the vaccine. For the construction of the definitive multi-epitope mRNA vaccine, the DNA sequence of the vaccine was modified by adding a Kozak sequence at the 5’ end to enhance RNA stability and translation efficiency [42], signal peptide Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) follows the Kozak sequence to facilitate the extracellular secretion of proteins and improve antigen presentation [43]. Additionally, an MHC I-targeting domain (MITD) sequence is added to the 3’ end of the vaccine DNA sequence to facilitate the presentation of CTL epitopes [44], then a TAA condon ends the translation. Besides, to stabilize the mRNA partial sequence of cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene Untranslated Region (UTR) was added as 5’ untranslated region (UTR), and a partial sequence of the human growth hormone was attached as 3’ UTR [45,46]. The full DNA sequence was translated into mRNA using the Transcription Tool. the RNAfold server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) and mFold server (http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold) predicted the mRNA’s secondary structure. TLR 3, 7, 8, and 9 have a high affinity for nucleic acid-related pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), especially the ssRNA genome of viruses, which are referred to as virus-associated molecular patterns (VAMPs) in this context. Therefore, we examined the interaction between mRNA vaccine sequences and several TLR molecules [47]. The sequences of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were obtained from the Uniprot database. The retrieved RNA sequences were processed using the imRNA tool developed by the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology in New Delhi (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/imrna/) [48]. This tool is based on the Motif-EmeRging and Classes-Identification (MERCI) program, which can scan RNA sequences to identify potential motifs with immunomodulatory properties. The RPISeq tool from Iowa State University (http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/) provides a cost-effective method to predict RNA-protein interactions by analyzing RNA and protein sequence data. The RPISeq tool runs on machine learning algorithms and generates output for RNA-protein interaction predictions in two main forms - Random Forest (RF) classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier [49]. Further docking analysis was conducted on TLR molecules that can bind to mRNA vaccines. The interaction between vaccine mRNA and the TLR receptor was predicted using the HDOCK server. Subsequently, PyMOL was used for further visualization of the interaction between TLR receptor and mRNA. The Jcat server is used for reverse translation and codon optimization of vaccine sequences. Escherichia coli K12 was chosen as the host to avoid optimization of the cDNA sequence of the vaccine for the XhoI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The cDNA sequence was inserted into the pet28a (+) vector using SnapGene software. Through screening with diverse epitope prediction tools, a total of 9 CTL epitopes (Table 1), 7 HTL epitopes (Table 2), and 8 linear B-cell epitopes (Table 3) were obtained. All epitopes exhibit antigenicity without toxicity or allergenicity, and the 7 HTL epitopes can stimulate the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.t001  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.t002  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.t003 By comparing the constructed SFTS virus genome library, it was found that most epitopes are conserved in a minimum of 170 strains, except for the epitope KSTEIHFHSGSLVGK, which is conserved in only 25 strains. Meanwhile, the combination of KSTEIQFHSGSLVGK and KSTEIHFHSGSLVGK epitopes provides coverage for nearly all virus strains in the genome library. The CTL, HTL, and B-cell epitopes are connected with AAY, GPGPG, and KK linkers, finally forming a vaccine protein comprising 486 amino acids (Fig 1A). The vaccine’s antigenicity was calculated to be 0.6948 and 0.856963 by Vaxijen 2.0 and ANTIGENpro, indicating strong antigenicity. Meanwhile, the vaccine showed no allergenicity by when tested by AllerTOP 2.0 and AllerFP servers, and no toxicity by the ToxinPred 2.0. According to the ProtParam software, the constructed vaccine has a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.53 with a molecular weight of 52.08 kDa, it has a half-life of over 30 hours in mammalian red blood cells (in vitro), over 20 hours in yeast cells, and more than 10 hours in Escherichia coli cells. With an instability index of 33.61 and an aliphatic of 70.39, the vaccine protein is considered stable and possesses high thermal stability. With a hydrophilicity index of −0.184, the vaccine demonstrates its hydrophilic properties. When overexpressed in Escherichia coli, SOLpro predicts a solubility probability of 0.5000 for the vaccine.

Then, the Robetta software predicted and generated the vaccine’s tertiary structure (Fig 2A), which was subsequently refined with GalaxyRefine to optimize the vaccine’s side chains (Fig 2B). The vaccine achieved a Molprobity score of 1.831, indicating good model quality. The Procheck software’s Ramachandran plot demonstrated that 88.8% of the amino acids resided in the preferred region, with 10.0% allowed, 0.2% generously allowed, and 1.0% disallowed (Fig 3B). The Prosa generated a Z-score of −7.64, indicating the model has a good stereochemical quality (Fig 3C). The ERRAT predicted an adequate score of 90.063 for the vaccine’s tertiary structure (Fig 3D).

We selected the docking results with higher clustering ranks, lower docking energy scores, and reasonable docking poses. To further refine these selected results, we utilized the HADDOCK 2.4 server to generate the docked complexes. Specific results can be found in Table 5. The results with low HADDOCK scores demonstrate successful interaction between the vaccine and the receptors. We employed the PDBsum software to analyze the docked complexes, aiming to elucidate the interactions between the vaccine and the receptors. The analysis revealed that the vaccine can form 18 hydrogen bonds and 5 salt bridges with HLA-A02:01 (Fig 5A), 7 salt bridges and 16 hydrogen bonds with HLA-DRB101:01 (Fig 5B), 2 salt bridges and 19 hydrogen bonds with TLR2 (Fig 6A), and 6 salt bridges and 16 hydrogen bonds with TLR4 (Fig 6B). These results suggest that the vaccine exhibits stable binding affinity with HLA-A02:01, HLA-DRB101:01, TLR2, and TLR4 molecules, thereby eliciting host immune responses.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.t005  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.g005  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.g006 In order to comprehend the stability of vaccine-receptor complexes within the human body, we conducted a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation using Gromacs v2022.1 software. RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) measures the difference between the simulated molecular structure and the experimental structure. The smaller the RMSD, the closer the simulation result is to the experimental result. The RMSD plot is an indicator of the structural fluctuations of the vaccine-TLRs complexes. Fig 7F illustrates that the vaccine-HLA-DRB101:01, vaccine-HLA-A02:01, vaccine-TLR2 and TLR4 complexes attained equilibrium at approximately 20 ns. The average RMSD are 1.69 (vaccine-TLR2), 1.55 (vaccine-TLR4), 1.77 (vaccine- HLA-A02:01) and 1.81 (vaccine- HLA-DRB101:01), all complexes tend to maintain a stable binding with their RMSD values fluctuating within a defined range (Fig 7A). Rg (Radius of Gyration) describes the size and shape of the molecule. Smaller Rg values indicate a more compact molecular shape, while larger Rg values indicate a looser molecular shape. Thus, the compactness of protein structures can be assessed through the analysis of Rg plots. As depicted in Fig 7A, the Rg values for the vaccine-HLA-DRB101:01, vaccine-TLR2, and vaccine-TLR4 complexes exhibited an initial decrease followed by fluctuations within a specific range after 20 ns. This indicates that these three complexes became more compact during the simulation and achieved stability at the 20 ns. Meanwhile, though there was no significant decline for the curve of the curve of vaccine-HLA 02:01 complex, it always fluctuates below 4.5 nm, still believing that the complex exists in a relatively tight binding. The average Rgs are 4.02 (vaccine-TLR2), 3.82 (vaccine-TLR4), 4.41 (vaccine- HLA-A02:01) and 4.30 (vaccine- HLA-DRB101:01) (Fig 7B). The number of hydrogen bonds reflects the strength of interactions between protein complexes, more hydrogen bonds indicating stronger interaction between proteins. The hydrogen bonds in the vaccine-HLA-DRB101:01 and vaccine-TLR2 complexes remain stable around 10, the hydrogen bonds in the vaccine-HLA-A02:01 and TLR4 complexes flucture and ultimately stabilize around 20 all complexes were considered stable (Fig 7C). RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation) measures the degree of variation in the positions of atoms within the molecule. Smaller RMSF values indicate more stable movements during the simulation process, and in the RMSF analysis of four complexes.

Residues in the vaccine-HLA-DRB101:01 complex, overall, exhibit lower flexibility. Residues 380–486, as well as residues 400–486, in the vaccine-TLR2 complex exhibit higher flexibility (Fig 7D and 7E). The SASA (Solvent Accessible Surface Area) refers to the area of the complex molecule that comes into contact with the solvent. Inversely, the smaller the contact area between the complex and the solvent, the larger the contact area between the complex molecules, indicating a tighter binding. SASA of four complexes reduced slightly during the simulation, indicting the binding between vaccine and receptors increased during the 100 ns (Fig 7F). Further, the GMX_MMPBSA v1.56 calculated the binding energies of the last 20 ns of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. The calculated binding energies between the vaccine and HLA-A02:01, HLA-DRB101:01, TLR2, and TLR4 were −130.60 KJ/mol, −145.58 KJ/mol, −97.03 KJ/mol, and −199.63 KJ/mol, respectively (Table 6). The result is visualized using the method of residue energy decomposition, where the binding energy of the receptor and ligand is decomposed onto each amino acid residue to identify the residues that contribute to the binding process (Fig 8). These results further demonstrated that the vaccine can effectively interact with immune receptors, and ultimately eliciting host immune responses.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.t006 (A) Complex of vaccine-TLR2; (B) Complex of vaccine-TLR4; (C) Complex of vaccine-HLA-A*02:01; (D) Complex of vaccine-HLA-DRB1*01:01.

The findings revealed that the multi-epitope vaccines provided coverage of 99.32% to the global population, encompassing 99.0% in China, 99.93% in Europe, 100.0% in the United States, and 90.21% in Australia (Fig 9). https://gitcode.com/gh_mirrors/py/pyecharts/overview?utm_source=highlight_word_gitcode&word=pyecharts)).\n https://gitcode.com/gh_mirrors/py/pyecharts/overview?utm_source=highlight_word_gitcode&word=pyecharts)). \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.g009 The C-IMMSIM server is utilized for simulating the host’s immune response to vaccine antigens. During the simulation of the human immune response over an almost one-year period, after three vaccine injections, the antibody levels progressively increase, reaching a peak level approaching 200,000. The antibody levels plateau at 30,000 after 150 days (Fig 10A). Additionally, three vaccine injections can augment the levels of IL2 and IFN-γ in the host (Fig 10B). As depicted in the figures, the population of B, plasma, and helper T cells undergo a sequential increase, followed by a subsequent decrease and eventual equilibrium during three vaccine injections (Fig 10C, 10D and 10E). Activated cytotoxic T cells (TC cells) exhibit an initial increase followed by a decrease, while dormant cytotoxic T cells initially decline and subsequently rise (Fig 10F). MA, DC and NK cells demonstrate an initial upward trend post-vaccination, followed by a subsequent decline, ultimately reaching a relatively stable state (Fig 10G, 10H and 10I). The simulation results suggest that the vaccine can elicit a robust production of antibodies in the host, potentially leading to long-lasting immunity. Nevertheless, additional experimental validation is required to ascertain its protective efficacy.

As a result of the improvement process, a 2274 bp cDNA fragment was obtained, containing the full-length epitope vaccine, as well as the tPA and MITD sequences. The cDNA fragment exhibits a CAI value of 0.96 with a 67.28% GC content, both falling within the optimal range, indicating favorable density and thermos-stability. Upon merging with the UTR sequence, the full-length DNA spans 2532 bps. Subsequently, RNAfold analysis the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble to be −776.90 kcal/mol (S1 and S2 Figs). Then, the imRNA processing tool did not identify any immunomodulatory motifs in the vaccine mRNA sequence. The RPISeq tool found binding scores of 0.7 (based on the RF method) and 0.62 (based on the SVM method) for the vaccine mRNA with the TLR3 receptor, both scores exceeding 0.5, indicating that the vaccine mRNA may bind to the TLR3 receptor. Besides, the SVM receptor binding scores of TLR7, 8, and 9 were all below 0.5, indicating that they may not be able to bind to the mRNA vaccine (S1 Table). Then, through the HDOCK server, the binding score between the vaccine mRNA and TLR3 receptor was determined to be −491.93, with a confidence score of 0.9989, indicating that the vaccine mRNA can bind to the TLR3 receptor (Fig 11).  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.g011 Graphical output illustrating these results can be found in the S1 and S2 Figs. The predicted results indicate the stability of the multi-epitope mRNA vaccine. Lastly, the vaccine’s DNA sequence was inserted into the Pet28a (+) plasmid between BamHI and XhoI sites for vector construction (S3 Fig). SFTSV is an emerging tick-borne virus that has garnered increasing attention due to its high fatality rate and frequent outbreaks [50]. How to treat and prevent SFTSV has always been the focal point of researchers’ attention. Recently, progress has been made in the treatment of SFTSV, and calcium channel blockers (CCB) have been found to effectively reduce the mortality rate, CCB can accelerate virus clearance by impairing viral internalization and genomic replication [51]. Prior to this, ribavirin was also considered a potential antiviral drug [52]. Besides, the gut probiotic Akkermansia muciniphila has been found to protect the host from SFTSV infection through its secretions [53]. However, overall, there is still a lack of effective treatment methods for SFTSV. Meanwhile, in the field of vaccine development, there are also some attempts have been made. Live attenuated vaccine platform is a traditional but effective strategy, the existing two types of live attenuated vaccines both achieve reduced viral pathogenicity through the editing of the Ns protein [54], which also indicates that Ns is the main virulence protein of the virus. Compared to live attenuated vaccines, vector vaccines or component vaccines can provide stronger targeting, and VSV-based Gn/Gc vaccine can induce strong humoral immunity [13], which is consistent with our understanding that Gn/Gc can provide potent neutralizing epitopes. The NP or glycoprotein precursor (GPc) vaccine based on the LC16m8 vector can reduce the mortality rate of mice, and the concurrent humoral transfer experiment once again demonstrates the importance of B-cell immunity in SFTSV infection [14]. Nucleic acid vaccines carries antigens coded by DNA or RNA, administering multiple antigens within a single immunization can induce both cellular and humoral immunity, particularly eliciting a strong CD8+ T cell response. Additionally, nucleic acid vaccines are safer and have stronger specificity compared to traditional vaccines [55]. Kang’s team developed a novel protective DNA vaccine encoded Gn, Gc, and NP/NS protein, this study also found that stimulating helper T cells with IL-12 can improve the vaccine’s efficacy [56]. Compared with DNA vaccine, an mRNA vaccine can provide stronger protection [57], mRNA vaccine can activate a balanced T cell and B cell responses, while reducing the risk of integration into the receptor genome. Furthermore, mRNA vaccines have demonstrated production advantages in fighting against COVID-19, such as flexible antigen design, simple preparation process, and the ability to rapidly scale up production capacity [58]. At this present, our team designed a novel mRNA vaccine and validated the vaccine with in silico methods. The core sequence of the vaccine is conservative epitopes from proteins Gn, Gc, Np, and NSs, which are considered to generate protective immunity. RNA viruses rely on RdRp for replication and lack proofreading mechanisms, this leads to easy generation of mutations in RNA viruses, allowing them to escape vaccine-induced memory immunity [59]. However, there are always relatively stable core sequences in the viral genome, alignment of 230 known SFTSV sequences make sure that multi-epitope vaccine screened from reference sequence of SFTSV can cover most strains without losing the protective ability during viral mutations. Meanwhile, to induce both humoral and cellular immune response, 16 T cell epitopes (including 9 CTL epitopes and 7 HTL epitopes) and 8 LBL epitopes were selected for mRNA vaccine construction, in addition to being highly conserved in SFTSV, these epitopes also possess strong antigenicity and suitable immunogenicity. Moreover, no homology were shown between selected epitopes and human or human gut commensal bacteria, to avoid inducing latent autoimmunity damage. To construct a vaccine with epitopes, GPGPG, AAY, and KK linkers connected epitopes, including a PADRE epitope for stimulating additional helper T cells, these linkers are chosen to facilitate cleavage and elicit an enhanced immune response [60,61]. Two adjuvants are connected to the epitope sequence by EAAAK linkers, β-defensin Ⅱ is attached to the N-terminal to regulate CTL and HTL response, in addition to its well-documented antimicrobial function, β-defensin II plays a crucial role in the chemotaxis of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR2 and TLR4 [62]. TAT sequence is attached to the C-termini for a leading vaccine across the cell membrane and stimulate the phagocytic function of antigen-presenting cells towards the vaccine [63]. Finally, the vaccine contains 486 aas with a molecular weight of 52.08 kDa, for vaccine design and subsequent synthesis, this weight falls within an appropriate range, analysis of the construction’s aa composition also indicates that instability index [33.61], and aliphatic [70.39] are within the ideal range. To further validate that the vaccine can synthesize stable proteins and raise immune responses after being taken up by body cells, we predicted the folding conformation of the protein in space with the ab initio prediction method, Ramachandran plot and parameters such as Z-score predict the rationality of protein spatial structures. Given the roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in virus recognition and induction of inflammatory cytokines, we further docked the vaccine protein with both TLR2 and TLR4, meanwhile, docking simulation between vaccine molecules and MHC molecules were also carried out. In all four docking simulations, vaccine molecular docked tightly with receptors. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were used to simulate the interactions inside the vaccine-receptor complexes in a water molecular environment. During the 100 ns computation, the RMSD results indicate the presence of stable interactions between the vaccine and receptor. RMSF (root mean square fluctuation) analysis provided insights into the flexibility of the residues while the radius of gyration (Rg) plots give out the degree of loosening in the complexes, results observed further supported that the complex is stable. In accordance to MD analysis, MM/GBSA estimation validates that the binding affinity between the vaccine and receptors are relatively high. Furthermore, the detection results of the binding between mRNA and TLR molecules showed that mRNA can bind to TLR3, but may not be able to bind to TLR7, 8, or 9. In virus infection, these TLR molecules may trigger excessive inflammatory responses, even leading to a cytokine storm. However, the binding of mRNA to TLR3 molecules can regulate the activation and proliferation of the TLR signaling pathway, leading to various cascades and cross-signaling pathways, which may help subunit vaccines function more effectively. At last, C-IMMSIM predicted the immune response generated after vaccine injection, high titer antibody responses were observed after infection, which is very important for the prevention of SFTSV. IgM and IgG increased significantly after vaccination and tended to maintain a relatively stable titer over a longer period of time, indicating strong and rapid response and long-lasting protective immunity. During the procedure of HTL epitope selection, the potential ability to induce cytokines was an important criterion, and later we noticed the vaccine elicit an increase of IFN-g, IL-2 and IL-4. Meanwhile, powerful cellular and humoral immune responses were observed, vaccination triggers the activation of B and T-cell populations, and ultimately, it forms immunological memory. In general, the vaccine is highly effective as expected. In this present, our group have designed a novel mRNA vaccine candidate to combat SFTSV with immunoinformatic methods. We selected multi-epitope mRNA vaccine as a platform. By incorporating immunodominant epitopes, we aimed to achieve improved targeting while minimizing undesirable side effects. Additionally, a design with conserved epitopes can offer a wider range of protection against different subtypes, also, a vaccine containing T and B cell epitopes are expected to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. Further experimental verification is required for this mRNA vaccine in vivo and vitro. After the procedure of transcription, capping, and packaging, the vaccine will be injected into mice to observe the immune response. It should be pointed out that the final efficacy of the vaccine still needs to be determined through in vitro and in vivo experiments. But in summary, the design of this vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate that performs well in simulations. Given the limited research on SFTSV vaccines, it can provide an effective strategy for the prevention of SFTSV. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s004 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s005 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s006 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s007 (TIF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s008 (TIF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s009 (TIF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s010 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s011 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012815.s012 (ZIP) For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\n        here.

Who should be prioritized for early vaccination when different groups manifest different levels of risks and contact rates? Answering such questions often becomes computationally intractable given that network size can exceed millions. We obtain a framework to compute the optimal vaccination strategy within seconds to minutes from among all strategies, including highly dynamic ones that adjust vaccine allocation as often as required, and even with modest computation resources. We then determine the optimal strategy for a large range of parameter values representative of various US states, countries, and case studies including retirement homes and prisons. The optimal is almost always one of a few candidate strategies, and, even when not, the suboptimality of the best among these candidates is minimal. Further, we find that many commonly deployed vaccination strategies, such as vaccinating the high risk group first, or administering second doses without delay, can often incur higher death rates, hospitalizations, and symptomatic infection counts. Our framework can be easily adapted to future variants or pandemics through appropriate choice of the compartments of the disease and parameters.

Since its beginning in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in nearly 750 million infections and over 6 million deaths as of April 2023 [1]. Vaccines have proven to be the most effective countermeasure to the pandemic by limiting transmissions and protecting especially vulnerable populations [2]. During its early stages, the vaccination drive was heavily capacity constrained with demand far outstripping supply and administration capability—a challenge that continues to plague Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) [3]. This is bound to be the case for vaccines developed for every infectious disease. The target population for COVID-19 is naturally heterogeneous with different individuals exhibiting different social contact patterns and different risks for developing a serious form of the disease and suffering hospitalization or death. Thus, under capacity constraints, governments and public health organizations must make the critical choice of whom to vaccinate first: 1) those who are at high risk of hospitalization or death 2) those who are likely to transmit the disease most, 3) a combination of the first and second set. The first group, referred to as the “high risk group”, is comprised of the elderly and the immunocompromised; vaccinating them protects them by significantly reducing the risk of severe symptoms, hospitalization, and death. The second, the “high contact group”, are those who manifest high contact rates, have large and dynamic contact sets, perhaps because of their professions (e.g. shopkeepers, bank tellers, receptionists, drivers of taxis, shared rides, waiters, bartenders, doormen), and may spread the disease the most; thus, vaccinating them aims to prevent them from infecting others, significantly reducing the reach of the disease in the populace, including in the high risk group. For COVID-19, most public health bodies prioritized the vaccination of the high risk group over the high contact group, or rather over a large segment of the high contact group, adopting the protection route [4]. The only segment of the high contact group that was prioritized over the high risk group (e.g. the elderly and immunocompromised), were health care workers, but they form a negligible segment of the high contact group. But was the choice to focus on protection optimal even if we consider the objective of minimizing only the death count? What if the prevention route minimizes the death count instead, by vaccinating first those who constitute the most effective vector of spread, which in turn reduces the spread of the disease to the most vulnerable? In particular, if a small fraction of the populace have much higher contact rates than the rest, then vaccinating them may inhibit in a short time the pathway of the disease to the most vulnerable. Next, while some vaccines have one dose, others need two doses [5]. For the recipients who opted for the vaccines that needed two doses, the public health bodies, at least in the US, scheduled the second dose right after the mandated minimum time between the two doses, while others await their first doses. But do public health metrics improve if first everyone is administered the first dose and then the second doses are scheduled for those who need them? Or is the optimal strategy a hybrid between the two extremes, i.e. delay the second dose by a certain amount to administer the first dose sooner to more individuals; the delay may be different for different contact and risk profiles as well. To answer these questions, we need a systematic methodology to determine the optimal vaccination strategy, for attaining well-defined public health objectives, considering both single dose and two-dose vaccines. Identifying the optimal vaccination strategy is imperative also because it provides a valuable benchmark for evaluation of any proposed vaccination policy. Comparing a proposed policy with the optimal informs by how much the former can be outperformed through a smarter design. The challenge in determining the optimal vaccination strategy for COVID-19 is multi-fold. First, COVID-19 manifests some fundamentally different characteristics in susceptibility and fatality rates as compared to other contagious diseases such as various strains of influenza, rabies, which have been known for a while, and, more recently discovered ones such as Zika and Ebola [6]. Specifically, vulnerability to COVID-19 has shown to be much more lopsided with respect to age (presenting greater risk to the elderly) as well as other underlying health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, or hypertension [7]. For example, patients above 65 years of age and patients with diabetes with complications experience increases in mortality risk of over 500% and 30%, respectively, when compared to healthy individuals aged 18 to 39 [8]. Complications here refer to conditions (e.g. heart conditions, kidney damage, and diabetic neuropathy) which are caused or exacerbated by diabetes [8]. In fact, 81% of US COVID deaths in the first year of the pandemic were individuals over 65 [9]. Thus, given the nature of transmission and vulnerability, the extensive body of research that exists for vaccination for the other diseases mentioned above, could justifiably assume either a fully homogeneous target populace or limit heterogeneity to age-based compartments or geography [10–12]. For example, studies of rabies have rightly focused primarily on geographic movement of animal populations which are common hosts (eg. [12]). The age or geography based compartments were often considered to differ in contact rates, but not in risks, even when they consider heterogeneity. Thus, the literature on vaccinations for other diseases do not incorporate the heterogeneity in both contact rates and risk level which constitutes a defining characteristic for COVID-19. Yet, incorporating this multi-dimensional heterogeneity by considering each individual as a separate entity usually leads us to optimizations of an inordinate size, which are computationally intractable because of the curse of dimensionality and the scale of spread of COVID-19 [13]. On the other hand, homogeneous abstractions, though computationally tractable, lose the essential characteristics of the spread and impact of COVID-19. Even the scale of spread of some of the previous diseases such as Zika or Ebola have been far more limited than COVID-19, with Ebola outbreaks being largely confined to West Africa [14], while COVID-19 afflicted all the continents. The much larger target populace amplifies the computation challenges that arise in determining the right prioritization based on individual characteristics such as contact rates and risk factors. We redress the above challenges as follows. We model the multi-dimensional heterogeneity for COVID-19 by grouping different sections of the populace in accordance with their risk factors and contact rates. Individuals in each group are assumed to be statistically identical in terms of risk factors and contact rates among each other and across groups, but those in different groups can have different contact rates and risk factors. Contact rates can vary significantly depending on profession and age. For example, retail salespersons have a reported mean number of contacts per day of 62 while the same figure for computer programmers was just 15 [15, 16]. Contact rates within groups can also be different from those between groups. As another example, contact rates among people under 65 in US have been reported to be above 8 contacts per day, and contact rates between people below 65 and people over 65 have been reported to be 0.6 contacts per day or lower [17]. The contact rates between groups depend on pairs in question. This group-based modeling provides a tradeoff between retaining analytical and numerical tractability and capturing the inherent heterogeneity. The number of groups and the specific criteria for the classification is a design choice. Vaccination in different groups however remains coupled due to capacity constraints on overall rate of vaccination across all groups together. We subsequently formulate the determination of the optimal vaccination strategy that optimizes public health metrics of choice (eg, death, hospitalization, symptomatic counts) by allocating different vaccine capacities to different groups at different times subject to the limit on the number of doses that can be administered (i.e. the vaccination capacity constraint). There is a growing literature attempting to provide guidance on COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. Most papers compare a set of pre-identified policies using simulations e.g. [18–23]. The most common among these policies prioritize based on age (e.g. [18]), others based on geographic locations etc [19–21]. Among these, a small set focus on LMIC settings (e.g. [22]) with the large majority confined to high income countries [23]. Incidentally, among prior pandemics, influenza may be the closest to COVID-19, and most vaccination strategies for influenza fall into similar categories, relying either on simulation of very few strategies (e.g. [24, 25]) or computationally costly optimization with limits on the feasible set of policies (e.g. [26, 27]). Such comparisons and evaluations often provide valuable insights, but the overall approach suffers from some fundamental limitations. First, in absence of the knowledge of the optimal vaccination strategy for attaining well-defined public health objectives, one does not know whether and by how much a future strategy, or even all past strategies, outperform the proposed strategies. Second, simulations require a large number of iterations to provide reliable performance estimates and each such iteration consumes significant time for even moderate size populaces, and the computation time and processor memory requirement for each iteration grows at least polynomially with the size of the populace. As a result, the works in this category which consider populations of the size that pandemic spread affects rely heavily on access to powerful computing resources like high performance computing clusters (e.g. [28, 29]). These simulations cannot therefore be conducted in settings which have limited computational resources such as local public health bodies in small towns of the US and throughout LMICs, which prevents the choice between strategies from being fine-tuned to parameters that evolve with time and can only be locally estimated. Barring few exceptions, most works consider single dose vaccines, though several COVID-19 vaccines require two doses. For example [30, 31] consider two dose vaccines, but both of these prioritize based only on age, as per a predetermined order, and choose between few predetermined delays for the second dose. The joint optimization of group prioritization and second dose delay has remained open even in the category that compares a set of predetermined strategies. Another computational approach chooses the optimal vaccination strategy for COVID-19 among the policies that do not vary the vaccination rates to groups over time (i.e. among static policies) (e.g. [32]), or among those that vary allocations over large predetermined time intervals (e.g. [6]). The limitation of these approaches is that they a priori rule out highly-dynamic vaccine allocations without considering if these can attain substantially better values of public health metrics. Besides, the appropriate time scale of optimization can not be determined a priori and universally, as different public health domains have different inherent flexibilities. The available approaches that optimize over predetermined fixed intervals can not easily generalize to different, specifically higher, numbers of intervals, i.e. they do not scale. For example Buckner et. al. deploy a two-step genetic algorithm with simulated annealing [6]. The computation time of genetic algorithms increases exponentially in the number of optimization variables. The number of optimization variables for Buckner et al. linearly increases in the number of intervals. Thus, the computation time significantly increases if the number of intervals increases (refer to S5 Appendix for more details). Again, these approaches may be prohibitively difficult in areas lacking advanced computing or the necessary expertise. All of the above only consider single dose vaccinations, and the generalization to two doses is not direct and is expected to increase the computation time even further and significantly so. We adopt a different design approach altogether. We do not restrict to any preselected set of vaccination strategies, or any predetermined decision interval. We instead consider the problem in its most general form, optimizing over all potential vaccination strategies, including arbitrary functions of time which can vary over any time scale and arbitrary variations across the groups, towards the desired public health metric subject to the vaccination capacity constraint. We obtain a flexible framework that can accommodate different number of doses and different public health metrics (e.g. death, hospitalization, symptomatic counts), and tailor the vaccination strategy to any contact and risk heterogeneity of the target populace, population demography, disease parameters, and vaccination capacity constraints. We accomplish this in three broad steps: (1) capturing the heterogeneity of the populace in both contact rates and risk factors through a novel partition of the populace into three groups: high contact, high risk, and baseline (Section 2) (2) modeling the spread of the contagion and the progression of the stages of the disease within and across the groups, as a system of a small number of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in a small number of variables, regardless of the size of the populace (Section 2) (3) posing the choice of the optimal capacity constrained vaccination strategy as an optimal control problem with the ODEs providing the state trajectories (Section 2). Optimal control has been deployed in designing dynamic vaccination prioritizations for several other contagious diseases (e.g. [33, 34]), but the deployment for COVID-19 will fundamentally differ on account of its distinctive characteristics. Overall, very few papers have applied optimal control to design of COVID-19 vaccine strategies [21, 35, 36]. [35, 36] both deploy optimal control to determine the optimal budget allocation between several different types of mitigation strategies for COVID-19 (e.g. social distancing, vaccination, testing) assuming that the target populace is fully homogeneous. [21] focuses on allocation of available vaccines among large sub-regions (e.g. provinces of a nation, with Italy as their case study) of a geographic region so as to minimize cumulative infections. They consider the population in each sub-region to be homogeneous in that every individual has the same risk factor and contact rate therein. In the above respective scenarios, the fully homogeneous abstraction, or the homogeneity assumptions within each sub-region rules out design of vaccine prioritization among individuals based on their contact rates and risk factors. Thus, the problems they seek to solve are complementary to those in this paper. Also, note that in practice different individuals within large or even small sub-regions (e.g. neighborhoods) have widely diverging contact rates (e.g. due to their professions) and risk factors (e.g. due to their age and underlying health conditions). Thus, even the vaccine rollout processes deployed in practice have enacted different priorities among different individuals living even in proximity [4]. Thus, our consideration of heterogeneity captures a crucial element of reality. We compute the optimal vaccination strategy for 911,250 instances of realistic parameters (see S4 Appendix for parameter selection), spanning different variants, disease parameters and population demographics of 139 countries and all states of US as well as specific case studies such as retirement homes, prisons, LMICs. The optimal solution, or a close approximation thereof, turns out to be easily deployable, and can mostly be computed within seconds regardless of the population size using standard numerical toolboxes and modest computation resources, which are usually accessible in local public health offices throughout US and in most LMICs. Owing to this computational tractability, we are able to evaluate the impact on the solution of 1) a range of disease and population parameters that arise in practice including in divergent case studies of interest, 2) restrictions on decision intervals, and 3) error in estimating the parameters. Finally, we show how our framework can be used by public health authorities in designing vaccine rollout strategies for future pandemics (Section 4). We summarize some specific findings from our work. We first list those that are particularly relevant for practitioners. These two findings imply that the optimal vaccination strategy, or a close approximation thereof, can be determined by comparing a small set (i.e. either two or three) of vaccination strategies, for both one and two dose vaccines. The comparisons can again be done in a few seconds using our framework even when the computation resources are modest. This facilitates the universal deployment of the framework by enabling fine tuning the choice between the few candidate policies to specific parameters that can only be identified locally. We now highlight the findings that have significance from a methodological view. Overall, our framework for the determination of the vaccination prioritization is practicable in (1) the ease of deployment of all the resulting candidate solutions, (2) the fast computation of the optimal solution even when the computation resources are modest as in local public health units in US and LMICs which allows such units to fine tune the solution they deploy in accordance with the local pandemic parameters, and (3) the ability of the underlying model to capture key public health metrics almost universally. COVID-19 manifests heterogeneity both in the evolution of the disease in individuals and in the manner of the spread. Different sections of the populace constitute the most potent vector of spread while others have high risk for developing a severe form of disease once infected. We capture this heterogeneity through a simple classification of the populace. We divide the populace of N people into three groups: 1) baseline (X) 2) high risk (Y), and 3) high contact (Z). We describe the rationale and method underlying this classification. The high risk are those who are old or have underlying health conditions, which exacerbate the risk of developing severe forms of the disease, namely symptoms, hospitalization and death, once infected, e.g. retirees [7]. The high contact group are those who have a large set of potential contacts spanning entire neighborhoods or even cities, but establish actual contact with any individual in their set of potential contacts infrequently. The baseline is the rest of the populace, i.e. those who are neither high contact nor high risk. The high contact group includes shopkeepers, bank tellers, receptionists at hotels, restaurants, waiters at restaurants, doctors, nurses, drivers of buses, cabs and shared ride, etc. For example the set of potential contacts of a shopkeeper or a driver includes entire neighborhoods or cities, but a shopkeeper or a driver meets any given member in their neighborhood or city infrequently. This group has overall high rates of contact with both of the other groups. Given their large and dynamic contact sets, individuals in this group are the most likely to imbibe an infectious disease early on and pass the same to a large number. Thus, this group constitutes the most potent vector of spread. The individuals who are not high contact, have small sets of “regular” contacts, (e.g. family members, colleagues, friends), with whom they connect frequently, and outside this set infrequently connect with members of the high contact group. The baseline group includes but is not limited to workers of the tech sector, financial sector, manufacturing sector, homemakers, and scientists. Note that a tech worker or a scientist would regularly meet their friends, family, colleagues—all of whom constitute a small set; and infrequently meet shopkeepers, bank tellers, waiters, drivers in their neighborhood or city. Thus, members in this group largely, albeit indirectly, connect through those of the high contact group. Considering publicly available data for the infection and death counts as a function of time in all states of US and 139 countries, we later show that the decomposition of the populace in these three groups helps capture the temporal variation of infection and death counts observed in reality (Section 3.1). We also show, using the above mentioned data, that decomposition into fewer groups, namely one (i.e. entire population is one homogeneous group) or two (separating individuals based only on risk factor or only on contact patterns) can not capture the temporal variation of both infection and death counts (Section 3.1). Thus, our classification is the simplest possible for capturing the heterogeneity in the contact and risk patterns of the populace which determine the spread and evolution of COVID-19. And, the classification based on contact patterns and risk factors allows us to capture the tension between focusing vaccination on high risk or high contact groups. To describe state transitions modeling the contraction and evolution of COVID-19 in individuals, we employ an expanded compartmental model that accounts for the disease states associated with COVID-19 as well as our three group partition. We imbue each group with a compartmental model of the disease progression which includes 10 states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), pre-symptomatic (P), asymptomatic (A), early stage infected (I), late stage infection (L), hospitalized (H), recovered (R), vaccinated (V), and dead (D). In general, we refer to the fraction of individuals in a disease state with the group as a subscript and indexed by time e.g.  where NX(t) is the number of susceptible, type X individuals at time t and N is the the total number of individuals. For ease of exposition, we first present a simplified model in which vaccines confer perfect immunity to infection (see Fig 1), an assumption relaxed in the model we actually use for all our numerical results (refer to details of this model in S2 Appendix). In Fig 1a we present a simplified state diagram in the case where vaccinated individuals and recovered individuals cannot become infected. Note that these assumptions are relaxed for our numerical computations (see S2 Appendix for further detail). Red arrow indicates exposure to a contagious individual, black arrows denote natural disease progression, and blue arrow denotes vaccination. Each transition (apart from exposure which depends on infected population) is labeled with the associated rate. Note that probability of becoming symptomatic (si), hospitalized (πi), and dying (λi) are group-dependent as denoted by subscript i. Here τ, η, ϕ, ψ, ζ, and σ are the reciprocals of the expected durations of the exposed, pre-symptomatic, early infection, asymptomatic, late infection, and hospitalized states, respectively. Refer to S1 Appendix for notation tables. Fig 1b depicts our three group model which dictates how susceptible and infectious individuals of different groups come in contact to spread the disease and how vaccines are allocated. Here I denotes a group’s vector of all infectious disease states. Note that as vaccination rate ui(t) for a group increases the fraction of individuals that transitions to the path that takes them to hospitalization or dead states decreases. Given the respective vaccination rates and number of susceptibles, the vaccination capacity constraint is expressed as ∑i∈{X,Y,Z} Si(t)ui(t) ≤ V0.

(a) Simplified COVID state diagram (b) Contact and vaccination model. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g001 The vaccine policy is specified as the fraction of the susceptibles of each group who will receive the vaccine at a given time instant t (uX(t), uY(t), uZ(t)). Thus, 0 ≤ ui(t) ≤ 1 at any given time t. We are therefore assuming that only individuals who do not have active infection, ie, susceptibles are vaccinated. This assumption is in line with CDC recommendations which state that vaccine should be delayed at least until symptoms and isolation criterion subside and ideally until 3 months from the onset of symptoms or positive testing [38]. Furthermore, when vaccine capacity is severely limited (as is bound to be the case early on in vaccine availability or in low resource settings), it is especially important that only susceptible individuals who can reap full benefit receive vaccines [18]. Note that symptomatics can be easily excluded from vaccination based on manifestation of symptoms. The exposed, asymptomatics and presymptomatics can also be excluded if all individuals are tested before they are vaccinated. Usually by the time vaccines are available for any infectious disease, tests for the same are widely available and are also cheap, thus testing before vaccination can be easily realized. But if vaccination can not be preceded with tests, then the exposed, presymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals will also receive vaccine doses, we show how our framework can be adapted to this setting in S2 Appendix. Note that all vaccination policies can be represented through appropriate choice of the functions ui(⋅). For example, one can consider policies which sequentially vaccinate groups, e.g. ui(t) is as high as possible for a certain group initially, while uj(t) = 0 for other groups in the same period, then the focus changes to uj(t) for another group, etc. Or, 0 < ui(t) < 1 for all groups in a certain interval, which represents “mixed” policies which split vaccine capacity between multiple groups. In fact, uX(t), uY(t), uZ(t) are allowed to be arbitrary functions of time, Thus, highly dynamic, complex policies are included among the vaccination strategies we consider. We consider that the vaccination capacity is limited, i.e. V0 fraction of the population (NV0 individuals) can receive vaccines on any given day. Thus, ∑i∈{X,Y,Z} ui(t)Si(t) ≤ V0 for each t. This vaccination capacity constraint is motivated by staffing and infrastructure limitations that arise in particular for emerging infectious diseases. Specifically the health care workers who administer the vaccines are limited. Also, only a certain number of doses can be stored on any given day in a health care unit due to limitations on cold chain storage space [39]. Thus, only a certain maximum number of doses can be administered on any given day leading to the hard constraint under consideration [39]. The dynamics of the system can be captured by a system of ODEs provided in Fig 2. While the set of ODEs described is deterministic, the state transitions are usually stochastic. It can be shown, however, that, under certain mild regularity assumptions, the fraction of individuals in any given state and group in the stochastic system converges to the solution of the ODEs at each time t in the asymptotic limit that the size of the population increases to infinity ([40]; Supporting Information C, [37]). The assumption is that the duration of each state for every individual is exponentially distributed; under this assumption the distribution of the number of individuals across the states and groups constitutes a continuous time Markov chain. Thus, under this assumption, the solution of the ODEs becomes a more and more accurate approximation of the temporal evolution of the actual state distribution as the population size increases to infinity. This constitutes an important computational strength as the system of ODEs can be readily solved regardless of the population size, while the time required to compute the probability of different population distributions across states and groups from the continuous time Markov chain representation increases exponentially in the population size. Thus, this latter computation is intractable for all practical purposes for populations of even moderate size. All notation and associated parameters are defined and presented in full detail in S1 Appendix. These ODEs have been obtained through an adaptation of the metapopulation model of epidemiological differential equations [37]. Each equation governs the rate of change of the fraction of individuals of a specific group and disease state. The equations are composed of both quadratic and linear terms. The quadratic terms (terms in red) correspond to the transmission of the virus, which involves interaction between two individuals, one contagious and another susceptible. The number of such interactions per unit time is linearly proportional to the number of such pairs, which is in turn linearly proportional to the product of the fraction of susceptibles and contagious individuals in the respective groups. We assume that individuals are contagious in the asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and early infection states after which, they are either recovered, quarantined, or hospitalized and unable to spread the disease further. The proportionality constant is the disease spread rate. Linear terms correspond to either (1) the progression of an individual through disease states (terms in black) or (2) the vaccination of susceptible individuals (terms in blue). The proportionality constants for (1) are the transition rates in and out of the states which are different for different groups. The proportionality constants for (2) are the vaccination rates which are functions of time and group. This system of ODEs consists of only 30 ODEs involving 30 variables, regardless of the population size. Note that this represents the simplified setting in which vaccinated and recovered individuals cannot become infected (corresponding to Fig 1).\n All notation and associated parameters are defined and presented in full detail in S1 Appendix.

This system of ODEs consists of only 30 ODEs involving 30 variables, regardless of the population size. Note that this represents the simplified setting in which vaccinated and recovered individuals cannot become infected (corresponding to Fig 1). \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g002 The state dynamics of the three groups are connected through (1) the infection across groups and (2) the dependence between the vaccination rate {ui(⋅)} allocated to each group at time t. The dependence arises because of the vaccination capacity constraint. If the capacity allocated to one group is high at any given time, those allocated to the other groups must be low because of this capacity constraint. We now seek to optimize public health metrics of our choice through a judicious selection of the vaccination strategy, namely the {ui(t)} for i = X, Y, Z, t ∈ [0, T]. Unless otherwise specified, we focus on minimizing the overall death count by the end of the time horizon under consideration, i.e. N(DX(T) + DY(T) + DZ(T)) (this is also the cumulative death count in [0, T]). We later describe how our framework can be adapted to minimize other public health metrics such as symptomatic counts, hospitalization counts, or socioeconomic costs related to the pandemic (S2 Appendix). The optimal vaccination strategy is the one that minimizes the overall death count among all vaccination strategies that satisfy the vaccination capacity constraint. Since the available choices include arbitrary functions of time, the optimal vaccination strategy can not be obtained by standard optimization, but needs to be characterized by solving an optimal control formulation, which we will shortly describe. The first question however is if the vaccination strategy that minimizes the cumulative death count needs to be obtained by solving any optimization or optimal control problem at all. Wouldn’t vaccinating all individuals in the high risk group first accomplish this goal always? To see why not consider the case that the high risk and high contact groups are respectively large and small in size, and the contact rates between the high contact group and other groups is much higher than the contact rates between other groups and within other groups. The initially infected individuals are all in the baseline group. Then, if the high risk group is vaccinated first, it will take some time to complete the vaccination strategy given the group’s size. During this time the infection may be transmitted from the baseline group to the high risk group through the high contact group. Once the infection reaches the high risk group it kills many individuals in this group before they can be vaccinated. Instead if the high contact group would be vaccinated first, its vaccination would be completed in a short time because of its small size and the virus may not be able to reach the high risk group in this time. Once the high contact group is vaccinated in its entirety, the virus can not reach the high risk group as it lacks a path to it from the baseline group in which the infection had originated. Thus, the death count in the high risk group is low. The mortality risk is low in other groups, so very few individuals therein die even if they are infected. Thus, the overall death count is low. In other words, vaccinating the high contact group before the high risk group may in fact reduce the death count as compared to when this order is reversed. Thus, the optimal vaccination strategy is not a priori obvious. We therefore proceed to formulate the optimal control problem:\n(1)\nwhere x refers to a state trajectory. x(0) is the state vector at the initial time, i.e. at t = 0, and its components are non-negative.  refers to the collection of state trajectories conforming to the system dynamics as specified by the ODEs. The last constraint in (1) represents the vaccination capacity constraint. The optimal control problem can be solved using standard numerical toolboxes to yield the optimal vaccination strategy. We use the numerical toolboxes Yop [41] and CasADi [42] for this purpose. Specifically, we employ the local direct collocation method to solve the optimal control by discretizing both the state and control spaces on a fine grid. The problem is then transformed into a large but sparse nonlinear program (NLP). Finally, this NLP is solved using the popular IPOPT framework (see [43] for further detail). Finally, we rule out the need to consider “mixed” policies which split vaccine capacity between multiple groups (until at least one group runs out of susceptibles to fully utilize the vaccine capacity). We prove that there exists an optimal vaccination strategy that devotes full capacity to a single group while the susceptibles of each type exceed the vaccine capacity. Only after the number of susceptibles decreases below capacity will such a policy ever vaccinate two groups simultaneously (see S3 Appendix) [44]. This analytical result yields a significant reduction in the set of optimal strategies which must be considered. This reduction is also of practical importance: strategies which focus on one group at a time can be deployed more easily and align with the common practice of phased vaccine rollout to target groups. We first validate our model by demonstrating its applicability to COVID-19 infection and fatality data over a period of 9 months (1 April 2020—1 January, 2021, the period preceding the introduction of vaccines). We show that despite segmenting the population into only three groups (baseline, high risk, and high contact), when the parameters are chosen correctly, our model is able to accurately predict both the spread of infection and mortality of COVID-19 as observed over the course of the pandemic in all the US states and 139 countries. We also demonstrate that any decrease in the number of groups substantially undermines the accuracy of prediction. We consider publicly available data on infection and death counts [45]. From census and survey data, we estimate the size of the three groups. Elderly populations are categorized as high risk while specific service industry and essential workers are high contact [46–48]. See S4 Appendix for further detail on how parameters were estimated from available data. Disease parameters are obtained from WHO, CDC, and Johns Hopkins (see S1 Appendix). We select the contact rates within each group and across groups using regression, such that the mean squared normalized error (MSNE) between the infection and death counts predicted by our model and the true values of the same is minimized. The square normalized error for infection (death, respectively) on a given day is the square of the difference between the predicted and actual infection (death, respectively) counts divided by the actual infection (death, respectively) count on that day. The mean square normalized error for infection (death, respectively) is the average of the square normalized errors for infection (death, respectively) over all days. The mean square normalized error is the average of the mean square normalized error for infection and death. The division of the square error by the magnitude of the actual infection (death, respectively) ensures that discrepancies in magnitudes of infection and death counts do not imply that the errors of the quantity with significantly larger magnitude dominates that of the other. Error can be quantified in different forms, such as mean square error, mean absolute value of error etc. We chose the mean squared error for analytical convenience as the squared error is a smooth function, specifically it is smoother than the absolute value particularly when the square and absolute values are near zero. Thus, choosing contact rates that minimize the mean square normalized error is computationally simpler than choosing those that minimize the mean absolute value of the normalized error. The minimum mean squared normalized error will be abbreviated as MMSNE. Different contact rates were chosen for periods of two months to account for changes in both government policy (e.g. start, relaxation, and end of lockdowns) and school openings which happen at low frequency. We now compare the infection and death counts predicted by our model with the above choice of parameters and those that were actually recorded. Although the numbers that were actually observed were used to determine the contact rates in our model, the prediction using those need not match the reality, and the MMSNE may be high. This happens when the parameter space of the minimization is not large enough to capture the complexity of the pandemic progression, e.g. if the population needed to be segmented into a larger number of groups to capture the complexity. We show that this is not the case for different locations with different population demographics and government responses throughout US and worldwide. Specifically, in Fig 3 we consider 2 US states (California, Florida) and an LMIC (Bangladesh) to demonstrate that the predicted values closely match the values actually recorded, the average difference between the predicted and actually recorded values is less than 1% for both infections and death. From the US, we choose California and Florida because these two states have divergent age demographics and government responses. Florida has a significantly older population as well as among the most laissez-faire NPI restrictions while the opposite is true of California [49]. We choose Bangladesh as an example of an LMIC—in general LMICs have significantly younger population demographics and different government responses as compared to the US. The MMSNE for California, Florida, and Bangladesh are very small, 0.0005, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively. Thus, our reasonably simple model has distilled the essential heterogeneity innate to the system. Here we show the accuracy of our model (‘Predicted’) when applied to the real infection and death counts of (a) California, (b) Florida, and (c) Bangladesh. The blue curves show the ground truth data [45]; orange and green show the predictions from our contact model and from a fully homogeneous model, respectively. Finally the red (purple, respectively) shows the predictions when only the heterogeneity in contact rate (risk, respectively) is accounted for.\n Here we show the accuracy of our model (‘Predicted’) when applied to the real infection and death counts of (a) California, (b) Florida, and (c) Bangladesh.

Here, four countries for which death and infection counts are available are excluded due to apparent irregularities in the available data (see S4 Appendix for further detail). As seen in Fig 4, the MMSNE was very low, below 0.006, for all US states. Across the MMSNE for all countries, the median, mean, first and third quartile are 0.002, 0.005, 0.0006, 0.005, 0.05. While this error is slightly higher than that of the states, it is still quite low. The increased error is mostly due to low population sizes and abrupt, non-smooth changes in infection and death counts (further detail in S4 Appendix). The low fitting error across the board shows that our model captures reality of geographical locations all over the world.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g004 We now examine if our model can be simplified further while retaining the quality of the fit between the predicted values and reality. We again study California, Florida, and Bangladesh. We first consider the model that assumes a homogeneous populace—that is, there is only one group. There is therefore only one contact rate, that within the group. The mortality risk for the homogeneous populace is chosen as average over all age groups. We determine the contact rate in different time periods using the same regression technique. Fig 3 shows that the predicted counts do not closely match the counts observed in reality; the average error in predicted infections was 1.86% and the average error in predicted deaths was 82.91%. Thus, a homogeneous model can at best match only one count, and greater degrees of freedom are necessary to match both counts. We now examine if increasing the number of groups to two provides the necessary degrees of freedom. We consider two groups with different contact rates but uniform mortality risk throughout the populace (which is average over the entire populace). The mismatch between predicted and recorded values remains similar, the average differences for the infection and death counts are respectively 1.93% and 82.85%. We now consider two groups with uniform contact rates throughout but one has higher mortality risk. Now, average error for the infection count increased to 6.95% while average death error decreased to 66.46%. Thus, all three groups are necessary for error values to be low, as three groups allows for heterogeneity in both mortality risks and contact rates. The heterogeneity innate to the evolution of the pandemic over a diverse population can not in general be captured by models simpler than ours. Having validated the model as above, we henceforth utilize the values of the parameters we extracted for three groups for all subsequent numerical computations using the model. Unless otherwise specified, we assume that our objective is to minimize the total death count. Recall that the challenge in determining optimal policies is that the space of potential vaccination strategies is very large—it can include straightforward strategies which vaccinate groups sequentially, complex time-dynamic policies which change focus day-to-day, and policies which split vaccine capacity among multiple groups at once. But our theoretical results summarized below in Theorem 4.1 rule out the need to consider the last class of policies. Using extensive numerical computations we show that the optimal policies lie in the first class in most of the cases that arise in practice, and the suboptimality of the strategies in the first class is limited even when the optimal strategy lies elsewhere. For a policy u(t), we will use U(t) to denote the vaccine allocation in absolute quantity rather than fraction i.e. Theorem 4.1. There exists an optimal vaccination strategy u such that, for each t there exist a(t), b(t), c(t) ∈ {X, Y, Z} all distinct and Ua(t)(t) = min(V0, Sa(t)(t)), Ub(t)(t) = min(Sb(t)(t), V0 − Ua(t)(t)), and Uc(t)(t) = min(Sc(t)(t), V0 − Ua(t)(t) − Ub(t)(t)). First, we clarify and interpret this result. Note that for each vaccination strategy there exists a first time t0 at which Si(t) < V0 for some i (until t0 all groups have enough susceptible individuals to be vaccinated at full capacity if they are accorded that capacity), and a first time tf at which ∑i Si(tf) ≤ V0 (i.e. the total number of susceptible individuals is below vaccine capacity). These times are different for different strategies. Theorem 4.1 essentially says that there exists an optimal strategy u which follows the following structures before its t0, between its t0 and its tf, and after its tf. Remark 4.1.1. The salient point of this theorem is that at any given time the optimal policy described above accords different priorities to different groups; as long as the highest priority group has enough susceptibles to utilize the full vaccine capacity, it allocates the entire vaccine capacity to that group and the rest are not allocated any capacity. The policy starts splitting the capacity among different groups only when the highest priority group at the given time does not have enough susceptibles to utilize the capacity. Even then, the highest priority group is given the maximum capacity it can utilize, the residual is given to the next highest priority group limited only by its availability of susceptibles, and so on. Remark 4.1.2. It is useful here to elaborate the extent of the above theorem. First, the theorem shows that such an optimal policy exists, but this optimal need not be unique. However, because such an optimal exists, the planner cannot achieve any further reduction in mortality by implementing more complex policies which instantaneously split vaccination capacity between two or more groups even when each group has enough susceptibles to utilize the entire vaccination capacity. Furthermore, while the specified optimal policy vaccinates one priority group at each instant (while it has enough susceptibles), our analytical result does not specify how frequently this priority group may change. We numerically study the number of switches in the priority accorded to the groups in the remainder of this section and find a maximum of 3 switches. To numerically study optimal vaccination policies, we vary disease parameters, initial population seroprevalence, and vaccine efficacy parameters over representative ranges based on best available estimates [45, 50–52]. Detailed derivations of all parameters and relevant sources are included in S1 and S4 Appendices. We obtain the demographic data from census as in the previous section. The default assumption is that initial infections are seeded only in the baseline group; we explicitly specify when we deviate from the default assumptions. We used the contact rates obtained from the real evolution of the pandemic as in the previous section. We also use additional contact rates from ranges of contact rates within and across age groups in 139 countries obtained from surveys and the sizes of the different groups [17]. Overall, the large range of contact rates we consider capture varying degrees of implementation and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and lockdowns in different US states and the 139 countries. Over all these parameter ranges, our model was instantiated and run on a fine grid of approximately 911, 250 settings (see S4 Appendix). We also demonstrate that our model is robust to parameter estimation errors (see Section 3.6). In 93.4% of the cases we considered, the optimal solution was either to (1) vaccinate the high contact group fully, next vaccinate the high risk group fully (2) vaccinate the high risk group fully, next vaccinate the high contact group fully. In both these cases, the baseline group is vaccinated at the end. We refer to the first as high contact prioritization and the second as high risk prioritization. In the rest of the cases there is an extra step where the optimal policy switches from high contact vaccination to high risk before returning to the high contact. In these few cases, the better performer of the above two simple policies had only 2.2% more deaths than the optimal policy. Even including these cases, across all numerical experiments, the priority group for vaccination changed at most three times over the course of the optimal policy, and the number of switches was three in only 6.4%. Coupled with our theoretical result, this simplifies our potential policy space down to two easily deployable policies even without any assumed restrictions on policy complexity. Seeing that the aforementioned simple policies perform well, one may question whether all simple policies, even static ones, perform similarly well in reducing mortality. To answer this question, we compare the death counts of the overall optimal policy with two more restricted policies: (1) the optimal policy among those whose vaccine capacity allocations to the groups are constant over the entire time horizon (static policy) and (2) the optimal policy among those whose vaccine capacity allocations to the groups are constant in periods of one month (monthly policy). The first policy is completely static while the vaccination capacities allocated by the second can vary with time but over large time scale. In contrast the overall optimal policy has been obtained by optimizing among policies that can vary their vaccination capacity allocation to groups as frequently as deemed necessary. We find that even at their best, the less dynamic classes of policies under consideration perform significantly worse than the general optimal. In particular, Fig 5a and 5b, show the additional mortality incurred by each of these restricted policies when compared to the optimal policy mortality as a percentage of the latter. The axes are measures of the two types of heterogeneity: the ratio of risk parameters of the high risk and baseline groups (x-axis) and the ratio of daily average contact of the high contact and baseline groups (y-axis). We see that as heterogeneity increases, the difference in mortality between the optimal and the two static variations is magnified. Furthermore, the suboptimality of the more static policies is especially sensitive to the high contact group. Intuitively, a very active high contact group significantly accelerates the spread of the epidemic, thus necessitating a more dynamic vaccine allocation strategy. Over all instances, the average increase in death counts under the two restricted policies as compared to the overall optimal vaccination strategy were 206.3% and 72.16%, respectively. In the extreme, the mortality of the static policy is over thrice that of the optimal. We note that the monthly policy has both lower death count and is more dynamic than the static policy. The most extreme difference between the two restricted policies occurs when the high contact multiple is high i.e. when the high contact group is very active. In this regime the monthly policy far outperforms the static policy (while both remain significantly less effective than the true optimal). Intuitively, a very active high contact group significantly accelerates the spread of the epidemic, thus necessitating a more dynamic vaccine allocation strategy. Fig 5a shows the increase in the death counts of the static vaccination policy over that of the optimal policy as a percentage of the latter. The x-axis is the ratio of death rates of the high risk and baseline groups (this is also the ratio of the symptomatic rates and hospitalization rates of the two groups). The y-axis is the ratio of daily average contacts of the high contact and baseline groups. As these ratios increase, our contact network becomes more heterogeneous and the suboptimality of the static policy increases. Fig 5b shows the same for the monthly policy, i.e. when the vaccine rate allocation to groups is allowed to change only on a monthly basis. Fig 5c shows the decrease in the number of deaths in the US baseline instance as one increases the number of decision intervals. The allocation of the vaccination capacity to groups remain constant over each interval. Number of days in each interval equals 365 divided by the number of intervals. Thus, more decision intervals allow for more dynamic policies. The death count is normalized by the maximum number of deaths across all data points.

The x-axis is the ratio of death rates of the high risk and baseline groups (this is also the ratio of the symptomatic rates and hospitalization rates of the two groups). The y-axis is the ratio of daily average contacts of the high contact and baseline groups. As these ratios increase, our contact network becomes more heterogeneous and the suboptimality of the static policy increases.

We consider one specific instance for this purpose: the US baseline setting in which contact rates and population demographics are averaged over the data reported in different states [17, 47, 53]. Fig 5c depicts how mortality substantially decreases as we increases the number of decision intervals, expanding our optimization space to allow for more dynamic policies. The dynamism of our optimal policies is integral to their performance in reducing mortality. If such dynamic policies are ignored, we do not have a proper foundation for reasoning about the efficacy of vaccination policies because such restrictions preclude identifying the minimum possible death count. A strength of our framework is its computational tractability. The mean computation time needed to determine the optimal vaccination strategy over all aforementioned parameter settings was just 10.86 seconds with a standard deviation of 39.88 seconds. In less than 0.6% of instances, the computation time exceeded the maximum allotted time of 500 seconds. Excluding these outliers, the mean computation time was just 8.04 seconds with a standard deviation of 14.45 seconds and a maximum of 142.42 seconds (a histogram of runtimes can be found in the S5 Appendix). These computation times were obtained using modest computational resources, namely an Intel i7 2.7 GHz machine with 16 GB RAM, which could also be readily available in local public health bodies and resource-constrained settings such as LMICs. It is noteworthy that most public health authorities implemented a strategy closest to high risk prioritization with the caveat of early vaccination for health care workers. High contact prioritization, on the other hand, was not often recommended, especially with the broader definition of high contact which we use. Yet, in the previous section we found that the high contact prioritization was optimal in several realistic settings. In this section we compare the mortalities under high contact and high risk prioritization policies by varying different combinations of parameters. We find that the high contact prioritization has substantially lower mortality than the high risk prioritization in 42% of instances; thus the prevalent norm has been suboptimal in many cases. To compare the two strategies, in each case, we vary two parameters as shown in the two axes of Figs 6 and 7, for given choice of one variable and include the relative decrease of mortality of one policy over another for all values of other parameters as considered in Section 3.2. We evaluate the death count of any given policy by utilizing the system of ODEs in Fig 2 with vaccination rates {ui(⋅)} that correspond to the policy. The default assumption is that the variant is Alpha; we explicitly specify when we deviate from the default assumptions. After all other parameters are set, R0 is computed via the next generation matrix method (see [54]) and contact matrices are normalized to achieve the desired R0, whenever we choose values of R0. Refer to S4 Appendix for further details. Fig 6a–6c, respectively, demonstrate the impact of 1) variants with different transmissibility and mortality characteristics 2) different values of initial seroprevalence 3) different values of R0.

We considered the three major variants thus far (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron) by choosing the transmissibility (probability of transmission upon contact with an infective individual) and mortality characteristics according to recent clinical data for each strain [55]. In particular, relative to the Alpha variant, Delta was nearly twice as contagious and with double the hospitalization risk while Omicron was more contagious still but with lower mortality rates [56]. The variant parameter in Fig 6b and 6c is applied as a multiplicative factor on transmissibility—this range allows us to consider potential future variants of concern. Fig 6 shows that, among the three variants, Omicron has the highest relative benefit of high contact prioritization and Alpha the least. This happens because Omicron and Alpha respectively have the highest and least transmissibilities. And, vaccinating high contact individuals reduces the overall transmission significantly which is particularly effective in decreasing the overall mortality when the virus has higher transmissibility. We also note that the relative benefit of high contact prioritization decreases with increase in the level of initial infection. This happens because if the initial infection is high the virus spreads in the high risk group during the initial time in which the high contact group is being vaccinated, which in turn substantially increases the mortality of the high risk group because of the innate high mortality rates of the infected in this group. The effect of R0, however, was non-monotonic with high risk prioritization attaining lower mortality than the high contact prioritization at extreme values of R0. We will explain the non-monotonic behavior in the next paragraph. \nFig 7 shows the impact of the high contact population size, viral transmissibility, and NPI (non-pharmaceutical intervention, i.e. social distancing, masking, lockdowns) efficacy on the two policies under consideration. Note that while the variants considered in the previous paragraph have different transmissibilities and mortality risks, here we study the impact of both these factors in isolation. We choose multiplicative factors of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 respectively on the baseline transmissibility to obtain the low and high transmissibility environments. NPI efficacy is modeled as a multiplicative factor on contact rates to capture different extents of social distancing, masking, and lockdowns. The low, moderate and high values of NPI efficacy respectively correspond to multiplicative factors of 1.0, 0.7, and 0.4, that is, no reduction in contacts, 30% reduction in contacts, and 60% reduction in contacts. Higher viral transmissibility increases the relative benefit of high contact prioritization due to larger reductions in potential infections. However, the relative benefit of the early vaccination of the high contact group is decreasing in the group’s size. This happens because larger groups need more time to be vaccinated. Thus, according vaccine priority to large sized high contact groups significantly delay vaccination to high risk groups; the disease may spread in the high risk group during this delay leading to high death counts owing to higher mortality rates therein. Note that R0 is increasing in both transmissibility and size of high contact groups. Thus, an increase in R0 can shift the relative benefits of high contact prioritization policy in either direction. Finally, the range in Figs 6 and 7 which exceed 20% difference or fall below -20% difference between the two policies includes values considerably higher than 20% or lower than -20%. Fig 8 shows the histogram of percent differences in mortality between the two strategies. Specifically, for certain parameter values in the above range, the percentage difference was as high as 71.71% and as low as -81.85%. Overall, the numerical computations reveal that, while the common high risk priority policy is optimal in the majority, there is a considerable range of realistic parameters for which high contact prioritization more effectively lowers mortality.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g008 We now compare the death counts of the high contact and high risk prioritization vaccination strategies and a benchmark vaccination strategy for three important case studies which arise in practice. These cases: (1) LMICs, (2) prisons, (3) long-term care facilities, have different characteristics, suffer from high vulnerability to the disease, and are hotbeds for the generation of new variants [57–59]. In particular, LMICs have a smaller elderly population, but, due to the greater prevalence of inter-generational households, high risk individuals are less able to isolate. They also have generally lower vaccine capacity [3]. Prisons also have a smaller elderly population, but have high levels of transmissibility due to unhealthy living conditions and presence of a large number of individuals in a relatively small confined space. Long-term care facilities have a large elderly population alongside a small core group of employees that have high contact rates with those at high risk. These differences were modeled by setting appropriate vaccination capacity constraints, contact rates between groups and sizes of the different clusters according to vaccine records, census data, government statistics, and contact surveys (for further detail see S1 and S4 Appendices) [3, 45, 60, 61]. We also consider the US baseline as described in Section 3.2. The benchmark vaccination strategy, referred to as Uniform, distributes vaccines among groups proportionally to each group’s size. Uniform is similar to vaccinating randomly chosen individuals subject to vaccination capacity constraints. \nFig 9a and 9b shows the differing efficacy of vaccine policies between the US baseline model and LMIC. Unlike the US baseline, the high contact prioritization strategy minimized mortality in the LMIC setting among the policies considered. This is because high risk individuals are in more frequent contact with the high contact group in LMICs than in the US. Thus, the high contact group constitutes a greater vector of spread to the high risk group in LMICs than in the US, and vaccinating the former on a priority basis helps protect the latter. Fig 9(a) and 9(b) also show how vaccine scarcity enhances the impact of right vaccine prioritization. Note that 0.5%, 0.2% of overall populace can be vaccinated every day in US baseline and LMIC respectively. We see that the difference in infections, hospitalizations, and YLLs between the best performing strategy and the alternatives is much greater in the LMIC than in the US Baseline. Even when considering deaths, the difference between uniform and high contact prioritization is much greater in the LMIC. We depict the percentage reduction of these attributes under each policy relative to the no vaccination scenario. Fig 9a (top left) is instantiated on US demography, NPI efficacy, and topology. Fig 9b (top right) is instantiated on an LMIC model with lower elderly population, greater high contact population, and higher transmissibility. Fig 9c (bottom left) is instantiated on a prison model comprised of guards (high contact), facility employees (baseline), and prisoners (baseline, high risk). This environment corresponds to low elderly population and high transmissibility. Fig 9d (bottom right) is instantiated on a nursing home model with a large elderly population (high risk), medical staff (high contact), and administrative staff (baseline).\n We depict the percentage reduction of these attributes under each policy relative to the no vaccination scenario. Fig 9a (top left) is instantiated on US demography, NPI efficacy, and topology. Fig 9b (top right) is instantiated on an LMIC model with lower elderly population, greater high contact population, and higher transmissibility. Fig 9c (bottom left) is instantiated on a prison model comprised of guards (high contact), facility employees (baseline), and prisoners (baseline, high risk). This environment corresponds to low elderly population and high transmissibility. Fig 9d (bottom right) is instantiated on a nursing home model with a large elderly population (high risk), medical staff (high contact), and administrative staff (baseline). \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g009 Next, due to the large high risk population, long-term care facilities have relatively high mortality rates [62]. Even with high individual mortality, high contact prioritization more effectively minimizes mortality (Fig 9(d)). Intuitively, because the high risk group is large in this setting, vaccinating the group fully would be a lengthy process during which the infection can spread among the group. Thus, cutting off the high contact group as a vector of the spread more effectively reduces mortality. The opposite is true in the prison setting because the high contact group is large and viral transmissibility is high due to living conditions [63]. Both of these ensure widespread infections. The best recourse is to vaccinate the small size high risk group first, this can be accomplished in a short time (Fig 9(c)). In all settings, the better of the high risk and high contact prioritizations, reduces mortality more than uniform vaccination. But the worse of the two prioritizations is sometimes worse than uniform vaccination. This is the case in the US baseline and nursing home as seen in Fig 9(a) and 9(d). Simply using one of the two prioritizations in all cases, without verifying which one has lower mortality count, incurs higher mortality even compared to uniform (i.e. random) vaccination in some cases. Thus, one must tailor the prioritization to the specific context. We now analyze how changes in specific model parameters affect the optimum (ie, minimum) total death count and optimal policy. We consider three modeling attributes: contact rates, group sizes, and vaccine efficacy. We fix the baseline contact matrix to be that of the US and vary a multiplicative factor applied on the contact rates in the baseline contact matrix (referred to as contact rate multiplier). We also vary the COVID variant, initial seroprevalence, and high contact population sizes as previously outlined in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 (see S4 Appendix for further detail). To study the impact of varying the contact rate multiplier, we instantiate our model on contact rate multipliers in the range [0.4, 1] at intervals of 0.075. The range was chosen to cover the estimates of contact rate reduction based on COVID countermeasures such as masking, social distancing, and lockdowns [64]. For each value of the multiplier, we vary the COVID variant, initial seroprevalence, and high contact population sizes and record 1) the percentage of instances in which the high contact prioritization policy is optimal 2) the average of the optimum value of the objective function (ie total death count)(Fig 10a and 10b). We similarly study the impact of the high contact group size by varying the values of the COVID variant, initial seroprevalence, and contact multiplier for a given group size and record 1) and 2) (Fig 10c and 10d). We vary the size of the high contact group size while keeping the size of the high risk group and size of the overall population constant, thus an increase in the size of the high contact group size implies a commensurate decrease in the size of the baseline group. High contact group size is varied in the range [10, 20]% of the total population. This range was chosen to cover the values of the states and countries for which we have data—for reference, the US high contact population is estimated to be approximately 16% [65].

However, the prevalence of the high contact prioritization as the optimal policy shows non-monotonicity with respect to the contact rate multiplier (see Fig 10a). Extreme values of the multiplier lead to improved performance of high risk prioritization. Intuitively, low contact rates indicate that the disease spreads slowly. Thus, there is little utility in attempting to decrease the spread further. When contact rates are high, the disease spreads very quickly. Thus, it will become widespread before it is possible to cutoff the spread by vaccinating the high contact group. Thus, high contact prioritization reduces mortality the most for intermediate values of the multiplier. This non-monotonicity mirrors the results depicted in Fig 6c which have been discussed in Section 3.3. We note that the mean optimal total death count shows considerable sensitivity to contact rates: it varies by 700%, from approximately 2.5 to 20 deaths per thousand. \nFig 10c shows that the number of instances in which high contact prioritization is optimal decreases in the group’s size. This happens because larger groups need more time to be vaccinated. Thus, according vaccine priority to large sized high contact groups significantly delay vaccination to high risk groups; the disease may spread in the high risk group during this delay leading to high death counts owing to higher mortality rates therein. In Fig 10d, we see that the mean death count changes only by 8.3%, from 10.8 to 11.7 deaths per thousand. The death count therefore shows relatively modest sensitivity to the size of the high contact group. This happens because as the high contact population increases, the optimal policy adjusts accordingly and is able to avoid significant changes in the death count. We also investigate the sensitivity of the death count and optimal policy to vaccine efficacy. Recall that vaccination has two primary goals: (1) reducing the severity of infection for vaccinated individuals upon contracting the disease (i.e. protecting) and (2) reducing the vaccinated individuals’ probability of contracting the disease (i.e. preventing). If a vaccine reduces only the probability of hospitalization and/or death from late infection stage, then it only protects. If it reduces only the recipient susceptible’s probability of contracting the disease upon being in contact with an infectious individual, it only prevents. If it reduces the probability that a recipient develops symptomatic infection upon contracting the infection, it protects and also indirectly prevents. This is because an asymptomatic individual does not develop symptoms (by definition) and naturally is neither hospitalized nor dies. The probability of transmission from the asymptomatic state is lower than from the symptomatic state. Thus, if a vaccine increases the proportion of asymptomatic infection, it reduces further transmission (and hence we use the characterization that it indirectly prevents). Usually vaccines both protect and prevent but often with different efficacy. It is noteworthy that current COVID vaccines drastically decrease the probability of symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death; and, to a lesser degree, decrease the probability of contracting the disease [56]. Guided by the above observations, we parameterize vaccine efficacy along the four possible modes of action—reduction in probability of a vaccinated susceptible contracting the disease upon coming in contact with an infectious individual, probability that a vaccinated individual develops symptomatic infection upon contracting the disease, probabilities of hospitalization, death conditioned on developing symptoms. Let an unvaccinated individual’s risk profile  respectively be the above four probabilities. For a given vaccine, we define its efficacy profile  such that a vaccinated individual will have risk profile . Thus, a vaccine with efficacy profile  provides perfect protection and prevention. We consider four different models of vaccine efficacy characterized by an efficacy parameter π: (1) a multiplicative decrease in probabilities of contraction, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death (), (2) a multiplicative decrease in only probability of contraction (), (3) a multiplicative decrease in the probabilities of symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death (), and (4) a multiplicative decrease in the probabilities of hospitalization and death (). Model (1) protects and prevents, model (2) only prevents, model (3) protects and indirectly prevents, model (4) only protects. Since current COVID vaccines drastically decrease the probability of symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death; and, to a lesser degree, decreases the probability of contraction [56], it is perhaps closest to protection and indirect prevention. For each model of vaccine action, we instantiate parameter π in the range [0.7, 0.9], covering the ranges indicated from COVID vaccine studies [51, 52]. We fix the contact matrix to be that of the US and vary the COVID variant, initial seroprevalence, high contact population size, and contact rate multiplier as described earlier in this section. For each model and at each value of π, we record 1) the percentage of instances in which the high contact prioritization policy is optimal and 2) the average of the optimum value of the objective function (i.e. total death count) over the parameter values varied here. \nFig 11b shows that the optimal death count is the lowest for protection and prevention; this is expected as it decreases all four relevant probabilities (contraction, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death). For similar reasons, protection and indirect prevention (decreasing symptomatic, hospitalization, and death probabilities) has lower death count than protection only (decreasing hospitalization and death probabilities) and prevention only (decreasing only contraction probability). When comparing the death counts of prevention only and protection only, we see two regimes: when efficacy is low, the prevention only vaccine provides greater reduction in death count, when efficacy is high, the opposite is true. We also observe that the mean optimal death counts in the protection and prevention, protection and indirect prevention, protection only, prevention only models vary in intervals [8, 14.2], [9.4, 18.4], [10.9, 23.1], and [17.5, 21.3] deaths per thousand, respectively as the vaccine efficacy parameter is varied in the shown range. Thus, the protection only vaccine is particularly sensitive to efficacy rate, exhibiting the steepest decrease (52.81%) in death count in Fig 11b with increase in efficacy, while the prevention only vaccine is the least sensitive (17.84% decrease). The protection and prevention, protection and indirect prevention vaccines are also considerably sensitive to vaccine efficacy (43.66%, 48.91% decrease respectively).

This is because the protection only vaccine does not reduce the probability of contraction of the disease of the recipient and therefore does not reduce the spread. So, it seeks to reduce death by preferentially vaccinating, and therefore protecting, those most likely to die, ie the high risk ones. For vaccines that both protect and prevent (either directly or indirectly), we see that the prevalence of high contact prioritization as the optimal strategy monotonically decreases in efficacy rate; and the prevalence is higher for the protection and indirect prevention vaccine between the two. For the prevention only vaccine, we see that the number of instances in which high contact prioritization is optimal changes non monotonically with change in the efficacy parameter. This mirrors the non-monotonicity with respect to contact rates which we observe in Fig 10a. The estimates of parameters will inevitably have some errors. We therefore investigate the robustness of the computation framework for the optimal vaccination strategy to estimation errors as mentioned in Section 3.2. We first investigate robustness with respect to disease parameters. We inject white Gaussian noise into transmissibility and fractions of individuals who become symptomatic (from the exposed state), are hospitalized (from late stage infection) and die (after hospitalization). That is, for each such parameter, the value was multiplied by  where  is the normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. We ignore the few cases in which the erroneous estimates become negative. Whenever the erroneous estimate of the fractions exceeds 1, we consider the fraction to be 1. The above parameters affect transition rates into some states. We take σ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.15}. Note that this noise model is a common one which has been observed in complex dynamical systems like our epidemic model [66]. While the true dynamics of the evolution were determined by the original parameter, the computation framework only had access to these noisy estimates. The optimal vaccination strategy computed using these noisy estimates is referred to as ‘noisy optimal’. The average increase in death count due to utilization of the noisy optimal strategy was below 2%, although, in extreme cases it was as high as 84.6%. Between high contact and high risk policies, the policy that has lower death counts was identified correctly under the noisy parameters in 89.1%, 88.2%, and 86.2% of cases, respectively for σ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.15}. Thus, overall the framework is robust to estimation error. When evaluating the vaccination policy made with noisy information, 88.2% of all instances exhibited a suboptimality of less than 1% when the controller only had access to noisy disease parameters (noise levels of 5%, 10%, and 15%). The histogram of the suboptimality in the remaining 11.8% of cases is included below in Fig 12.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g012 We now consider robustness with respect to errors in estimating: 1) contact rates, 2) size of the high contact group, and 3) vaccine efficacy. For robustness to errors in estimating contact rates, we apply a multiplier on the contact rate matrix as in Section 3.5 and consider errors in estimating it. We inject multiplicative Gaussian noise into 1) the contact rate multiplier, 2) the size of the high contact group, and 3) the vaccine efficacy as we did for the disease parameters, one at a time. To be consistent with our sensitivity analysis in Section 3.5, we consider the protection and prevention vaccine model as described there, and an efficacy value of 0.75, which is towards the lower end of the realistic range. We would describe our findings for higher vaccine efficacy as well. Fig 13 shows the resulting suboptimality as a function of σ. The resulting suboptimality is small in each case. Thus the death count by and large only increases marginally when these parameters are estimated erroneously, although the optimum value of the death count is considerably sensitive to values of different parameters as seen in Section 3.5. We next explain why this is the case.  \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g013 Robustness to error in estimation of parameters ultimately depends upon how much the optimal policy varies as a function of the parameter. Even if the optimal death count varies rapidly with small changes in a parameter, the optimal policy may be stable. For example, in Fig 11, for the protection only vaccine, as efficacy rate increases, the death count decreases rapidly (see Fig 11b), however, there is no change in the optimal policy (see Fig 11a). Thus, the policy that is optimum at the true value of the efficacy rate is computed as optimum even for the estimated value, which results in the minimum possible death count, regardless of the estimation error. Thus, such a system would be perfectly robust to estimation errors for the efficacy rate, although the optimal value of the death count is itself quite sensitive to the value of the efficacy rate. We now investigate how much the optimal policy varies as a function of the three parameters we are now considering, to understand why the system turned out to be robust to estimation errors. We vary each of the above three parameters, one at a time, over realistic ranges as described in Section 3.5. When we vary one parameter, we fix the other two at their default values. Throughout all of the specified instances, the optimal policy was the one with lower death count between HRP and high contact prioritization (HCP). Fig 14 provides the death counts under HRP and HCP, thus, the optimal vaccination policy can be easily discerned between the two at each instance. We note that the optimal policy remains the same in large segments, and switches between HRP and HCP only once in the studied range. If the true and estimated values of a parameter are in the same segment, e.g. the green star and blue circle on the x-axis of Fig 14b, they both yield the same optimum policy; in this case, even if the estimation error is large, the optimal policy is identified correctly and no suboptimality is incurred. These figures show the death counts (as percent of the total population) of HCP (blue curve) and HRP (orange curve) vaccine policies as a function of the contact rate multiplier, high contact population size, and vaccine efficacy, respectively from left to right. The blue (respectively, red) shaded region represents the regime where HCP (respectively, HRP) is optimal. In Fig 14b, we identify the crossover threshold (where HCP regime switches to HRP or vice versa) by the vertical black line. As an example, suppose the true value of the high contact group size is 15% (indicated by the green star), but the estimated value is 11.5% (indicated by the blue circle on the x-axis). Then there is no suboptimality as both are in the region in which the same policy, namely HRP in this case, is deemed optimal. However, if the estimated value is 7.75% (indicated by the red circle on the x-axis), HCP, rather than HRP, would be computed optimal. The magnitude of the resulting suboptimality is indicated by the vertical red bar.\n These figures show the death counts (as percent of the total population) of HCP (blue curve) and HRP (orange curve) vaccine policies as a function of the contact rate multiplier, high contact population size, and vaccine efficacy, respectively from left to right. The blue (respectively, red) shaded region represents the regime where HCP (respectively, HRP) is optimal. In Fig 14b, we identify the crossover threshold (where HCP regime switches to HRP or vice versa) by the vertical black line.

The magnitude of the resulting suboptimality is indicated by the vertical red bar. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g014 The estimation error does however lead to suboptimality, when the true and estimated values are in different segments. Then, the estimated value would yield HRP as the optimum policy, when HCP is the true optimum (ie, the optimum at the true value), or vice versa. Then, the amount of suboptimality is at most the difference in death counts attained by these two policies at the true value of the parameter (see illustration in Fig 14b). This difference is 0 when the true value of the parameter is the crossover point (that is, the point at which the HCP and HRP curves intersect) and increases as the distance between the true value and the crossover point increases. But if the true value of a parameter is far off from the crossover point, the estimated value can only be in a different segment (ie, on the other side of the crossover point) if the difference between the true and estimated values is large. This can only be caused by large values of the noise multiplier, which occur with low probability. Thus, the amount of suboptimality remains small with high probability. Thus, the system is robust to error in estimating these parameters. The above explanations suggest that the suboptimality resulting from estimation error increases in: 1) the lengths of the segments in which the optimal policy is the same and the number of changes in the optimal policy 2) the difference in death counts attained by HCP and HRP. Fig 14 suggests that the first is similar for variation of all three parameters. But the second is different for variation of the three parameters. Specifically, the death counts of HCP and HRP are close for different values of the contact multiplier, while they differ most as high contact group size is varied. The difference is intermediate when vaccine efficacy is varied, but is closer to that for variation of the high contact group size. Thus, intuitively, we expect the suboptimality to be the smallest due to error in estimating contact rates, and larger for errors in estimating the high contact group size and vaccine efficacy. Fig 13 confirms this intuition. The suboptimalities incurred for noisy high contact group size and noisy vaccine efficacy are similar for low values of the variance σ2 of the multiplicative noise distribution, but as this variance increases the suboptimality for the former is clearly larger. This is because for large variance, estimation errors are high with a higher probability, and when estimation errors are high, the true and estimated values can be in different segments even if the true value is far from the crossover point. When the true value of the high contact group size is far off from the crossover point, the difference in the death counts of HCP and HRP is larger, than when the true value of the vaccine efficacy is far off from the crossover point. This leads to higher expected suboptimality for errors in estimating the high contact group size than in the vaccine efficacy for high noise variance. Considering the expected suboptimality as a quantitative measure of robustness, we note that the system is least to most robust in errors in estimating the high contact population size, followed by vaccine efficacy and then contact rate multiplier. When the true value of the vaccine efficacy is set at a value higher than 0.75 the suboptimality is much lower. This is because then the optimal policy is the same (specifically, HRP), for large ranges of the values of the other two parameters we vary. Finally, note that Fig 14 also shows a sensitivity analysis of the optimal policy, which is geared towards further elucidating the robustness results. In each figure of Fig 14, we fix all but one parameter. This helps isolate the effects of specific parameters, and, thus, allows us to study robustness with respect to chosen parameters of interest, but at fixed values of other parameters. In contrast, for the sensitivity analysis done in Section 3.5, we vary all parameters in each figure, specifically for each value of one parameter, we studied a statistic for the aggregate of variations of all other parameters, which allowed us to analyze the sensitivity of the aggregate with respect to variation of the isolated parameter. We now consider optimal vaccination strategies that minimize the time averages of symptomatic and hospitalization counts as the public health objectives. The optimal control formulations that minimize these objectives can be found in S2 Appendix. Again we found that in most cases (90.91%) the optimal vaccination strategies was either the high contact or the high risk prioritization strategies. In the remaining cases, the average suboptimality of the better of the two was 2.26% and 5.99% for the two objectives respectively. \nFig 15 shows how the change in objective function affects the relative performances of the high contact and high risk prioritization strategies. The high contact prioritization strategy outperforms the high risk prioritization strategy for greater number of instances when minimizing symptomatics rather than deaths is the public health objective because the increased rates of hospitalization and death of the high risk individuals do not affect the symptomatic count. Similarly, minimizing hospitalizations reveals an intermediate result where high risk prioritization is more important than when minimizing symptomatics but less important than when minimizing deaths. This aligns with our intuition that the high risk group drives the largest share of the death count while the high contact group is predominantly responsible for spreading the disease. Fig 15a–15c respectively demonstrate the policy landscape when the objective is to minimize time average of symptomatic counts, time average of hospitalization counts, and overall death counts.\n Fig 15a–15c respectively demonstrate the policy landscape when the objective is to minimize time average of symptomatic counts, time average of hospitalization counts, and overall death counts. \n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.g015 We formulate the problem of determining the optimal two dose vaccination strategy in S2 Appendix. When considering two dose vaccination, our decision space becomes richer as the second dose can be delayed by any given amount to accommodate the first doses for all or some groups. The decision problem therefore consists of the amount of delay for each group and the ordering of both doses. Different countries have implemented different delays and orderings for the two doses [67, 68]. There is an additional constraint now: the first dose must precede the second dose for every individual. In addition to the contributory factors considered so far, the optimal decision also depends on the degree of immunity provided by the first dose. We ran our two dose model on the same parameter combination detailed in the first subsection. The range of single dose efficacy was 40% to 80% in intervals of 10% in line with clinical data from multiple available vaccines [69]. In the 4,556,250 instances we considered, the optimal policies were those that administer (1) both doses to high risk group, then both doses to high contact group, then both doses to the baseline group (60.91% of instances); (2) both doses to high contact group, then both doses to high risk group, then both doses to the baseline group (7.27% of instances); (3) first dose to high contact group, then first dose to high risk group, then second dose to high contact group, then second dose to high risk group, then both doses to baseline group (30% of instances); (4) both doses to high risk group, first dose to high contact group, first dose to baseline group, first dose to high contact group, then second dose to baseline group (1% of instances); and (5) first dose to high contact group, both doses to high risk groups, second dose to high contact group, then both doses to baseline group (1% of instances). Clearly these candidate policies are easy to deploy. In 98% instances the optimal policy was one of the first three candidates. Overall, 69.18% of optimal policies (policies (1), (2), and (4)) did not delay second doses to accommodate first doses to multiple groups; in these “non-delay” cases the optimal strategy follows either the high contact or high risk prioritization policies and provides both doses to these entire groups in one go. In the remaining cases, the optimal policy opted to delay second doses for one or more groups. Thus, there are regimes where delaying second doses can provide significant additional mortality reduction. Here it is useful to characterize when delaying second doses is beneficial in relation with our single dose studies. We will refer to instances where high risk prioritization was optimal in the single dose model as high risk prioritization regime and the same for high contact prioritization. We find that delaying the second dose is never beneficial in high risk prioritization regime. In this regime the optimal strategy focuses on those most vulnerable to the pandemic, therefore, interim efficacy after just one dose is not sufficient for this strategy. In high contact prioritization regimes, for sufficiently high interim vaccine efficacy (>70%), we see that delaying the second dose of the high risk group and accommodating first doses to others within this delay can lead to significant mortality reduction (31.62% on average) over the best alternative non-delay policy. Put simply, if the protection of one dose is sufficiently high, then delaying second doses and accommodating first doses to others can help reduce mortality. It is also effective in reducing the number of infections and, thus, may effectively reduce the burden on health systems or economic impact of the pandemic in some regions. We have so far considered that the populace can be partitioned into three groups: (1) high contact (and low risk), (2) high risk (and low contact) (3) baseline (both low contact and low risk). This decomposition need not however cover the populace entirely. This is because in principle there can be an overlap between high contact and high risk groups, which this classification ignores. The rationale for ignoring this overlap is that it is minimal in practice, because the individuals in the high contact group are of working age and are usually in good health, therefore their risk of developing a severe form of the disease is generally low. The fact that this overlap is minimal throughout the world is objectively borne out from how closely our model based on the three group decomposition predicts the temporal variation of infection and death count which was observed in reality across the world (see section 3.1). It is difficult to reliably estimate the exact extent of this overlap even in US, but using demographic data from census, employment data from surveys, and health data for conditions that cause high risk from a variety of sources including CDC, we estimate that the overlap would be lower than 1.9% of the overall population in US—we believe the actual overlap to be significantly lower (refer to S6 Appendix for our calculations, and the reason why the actual overlap is likely to be significantly lower). Since however this overlap is positive, and can not be reliably estimated all over the world, we now augment our model with a fourth group which is comprised of overlap, that is, it is both high contact and high risk. This group, denoted as W or HCHR (high contact and high risk) henceforth, will have the contact rates of the high contact group Z (a.k.a. HCLR, high contact and low risk) and the symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death probabilities of the high risk group Y (a.k.a. LCHR, low contact and high risk). In practice, W may refer to elderly high contact workers or high contact workers with comorbidities. In the new terminology, group X, which comprises of low contact and low risk individuals would be referred to as LCLR. The ODEs in Fig 2 are defined for general groups and can thus be applied directly now considering i ∈ {W, X, Y, Z}. We numerically study this augmented model by solving instances using this model while varying contact rates, group sizes, COVID variants, R0, NPI efficacy, and initial infection rate as in the results reported in Section 3.2. Since there are four groups to consider, we also additionally vary the size of group HCHR. Specifically, we consider HCHR group sizes of {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10}% of the total US population. We therefore run ∼5.5M instances, instead of ∼1 M instances considered for the results reported in Section 3.2. Across all these instances, the HCHR group was always given first priority for vaccination by the optimal policy. Intuitively this is because individuals in this group spread the disease at the highest rate while they are in states from which the disease can be spread (that is the asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and early infection) and they have the highest risk of developing serious forms of the disease leading to hospitalization and death. Since usually the HCHR group is small in size the vaccination process for such individuals is concluded in a short time if they are accorded the first priority as the optimal policy does. Subsequently, the other groups ought to be vaccinated, whose relative priority in the optimal policy can be determined by solving the optimal control problem formulated for the three groups as in Section 2 and which has been reported in Sections 3.2 to 3.7. Thus for a wide range of parameters seen for COVID the optimal vaccination policy for four groups can be obtained through a simple and intuitive augmentation of that obtained for three groups. We now summarize how our contributions have advanced the state of the art on research on COVID-19 vaccination strategy. We have provided a framework for obtaining vaccination strategies that attain several desired public health objectives (e.g. minimizing symptomatic events, hospitalization, death counts) subject to vaccination capacity constraints. The framework incorporates both single dose and multidose vaccines, arbitrary combination of parameters and attributes that occur in practice such as reinfection, breakthrough infections. Our framework relies on the following methodological innovations: 1) capturing the innate heterogeneity of COVID-19 in contact and risk profiles through classification of the populace into three groups 2) formulating the optimization of a variety of public health objectives subject to vaccination capacity constraints as an optimal control problem with the state space evolution modeled as ODEs. We optimize vaccination strategy among literally all possible strategies including highly dynamic ones and without any constraint on how often the capacity allocations can be changed among groups. Such an optimal strategy, even when difficult to deploy, provides a valuable benchmark for comparisons of any proposed policy. Our work provides this benchmark, and goes beyond by providing a few (two to three depending on the number of doses of vaccines) easy-to-deploy strategies, at least one of which is optimal or near-optimal in a wide array of parameter combination. Our framework typically identifies optimal vaccination strategies within seconds for single dose vaccine using modest computation resources which are usually available in public health centers including in the LMICs. For multi-dose vaccines the computation time merely increases to minutes. Owing to this computational tractability we could present results for large landscapes of 911,250 instances involving variations of parameters in large realistic ranges (Section 3). Large landscapes allow for more reliable conclusions on how the optimal strategy and the optimal value of the public health objective changes with variations in parameter values; large landscapes also help identify near-optimal, easy-to-deploy vaccination strategies which we accomplish. In contrast, even for the simplest scenario of single dose vaccines, no breakthrough or reinfection, the previous works are largely computationally intensive. Most of the previous published work has been limited to evaluations and comparisons of a handful of vaccination strategies by simulations; a smaller class of previous work optimized among a restricted class of strategies which either do not change capacity allocation to groups at all (i.e. fully static strategies) or change once in a large predetermined decision intervals (i.e. limited dynamism). We show that allowing fully dynamic allocation of vaccine capacities among different population groups (i.e. not restricting the size of decision intervals) substantially enhances public health metrics; the performance in fact improves with increase in the allowed dynamism. Our vaccination strategy is therefore able to significantly outperform the static or limited-dynamism strategies. Our framework also enables the analysis of sensitivity of the optimal vaccination strategy and the optimum value of public health objective functions to variation of crucial parameters, which we do for realistic ranges of a variety of parameters with minimizing death count as the public health objective. Our framework does assume the knowledge of relevant disease parameters, namely the contact rates of different groups, size of groups, vaccine efficacy, and disease parameters (transmissibility and duration of different disease states and rates of symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death). Our robustness study (see Section 3.6) shows that the optimal policies are generally robust to imperfect knowledge of disease parameters, group sizes, vaccine efficacy, and contact rates. Focusing on contact rates, vaccine efficacy and group sizes, we explain why this is the case and identify key attributes which determine the extent of this robustness. Considering quantitative criteria for assessing robustness, we find that the robustness is the highest (respectively, lowest) to errors in estimating contact rates (respectively, size of the high contact group). The disease parameters are also consistent over time for a given strain of virus. The contact rates, however, may well change over the course of the pandemic even for a single strain. As detailed in Section 3.1, we allow contact rates to change every two months to account for infrequent shifts (i.e. lockdown changes and school openings); however, the controller is assumed to have knowledge of these contact rates over the entire course of the pandemic. COVID-19 is not over yet and new variants are emerging in different parts of the world. It is unclear if the same vaccines will be effective for future variants. If not, then the vaccination process will need to restart from scratch. In addition, given how frequently pandemics have recurred in recorded human history [70], an entirely new pandemic is likely to emerge at some point in future, and it is imperative to be prepared for countering the same with a well-founded vaccination strategy. We describe how this paper can provide a vaccination strategy for a future variant or pandemic. The stages of the disease we consider appear with some variation in different contagious diseases which spread through contact. The variations are likely to be in the transition rates between the stages and in risk profiles. The distinguishing aspect of our model is that the risks of hospitalization and death significantly increase with age and poor health. Our framework will provide the optimal, or near-optimal vaccination strategy, whenever these general principles hold. This is likely to be the case for future variants and possibly for one or more future pandemics. In such instances, the framework will proceed as follows: For possible future pandemics, and current evolving pandemic response strategies, our framework’s flexibility, computational efficiency, and usability present a new practicable pathway for systematically reasoning about optimal vaccination policies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.s002 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.s003 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.s004 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.s005 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316294.s006 (PDF) For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\n        here.

After he first made the gesture, Musk then turned around to members of the crowd who were seated behind him and, with his back to the camera, repeated the gesture. ‘My heart goes out to you,’ Musk added… One of many examples: “”WE ARE FUCKING BACK” the administrator of a Nazi meme channel on Telegram wrote under a clip of Musk giving the salute.'” • I must confess that when I first saw this take I filed under symbol manipulators looking for symbols and then making leaps in reasoning based on the symbols (which is a very bad habit in the idpol space).

I normalize all-caps to title caps but in this case I’m not, because all the EOs have this formatting. I hope readers can give this a close reading, but while the pre-inaugural DOGE set a horrid precedent, this version seems not so bad. The EO hijacks the United States Digital Service (USDS), which Obama put in place after Silicon Valley techies saved his bacon my making the ObamaCare website work. That’s a clever idea! ” The United States Digital Service is hereby publicly renamed as the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and shall be established in the Executive Office of the President.” And: “In consultation with USDS, each Agency Head shall establish within their respective Agencies a DOGE Team of at least four employees, which may include Special Government Employees, hired or assigned within thirty days of the date of this Order. Agency Heads shall select the DOGE Team members in consultation with the USDS Administrator. Each DOGE Team will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney. Agency Heads shall ensure that DOGE Team Leads coordinate their work with USDS and advise their respective Agency Heads on implementing the President ‘s DOGE Agenda.” • This shows, at least, somebody was thinking about process. (“Special Government Employees” were what the the pre-inaugural DOGE operatives — the dudes going around interviewing civil servants — should have been. “‘Everyone wants him out’: How Musk helped boot Ramaswamy from DOGE” [Politico]. “Musk, the tech tycoon and Donald Trump confidant, made it known that he wanted Ramaswamy out of DOGE in recent days, according to three people familiar with Musk’s preferences who, like others for this article, were granted anonymity to discuss them. An ill-received holiday rant on X by Ramaswamy about H-1B visas apparently hastened his demise…. Ramaswamy maintained to confidants as late as Saturday evening that he was actively involved in DOGE, saying he was at work writing executive orders, according to six people who had spoken with him. But a person familiar with the arrangement said he had done almost no DOGE-related work since early December. As recently as last week, Ramaswamy was hoping to achieve some early wins at DOGE before leaving to pursue a gubernatorial bid. Now Ramaswamy and his allies are laboring to put a positive spin on his departure, coming just as Trump takes office.” •    2024 Post Mortem “The Sad Tale of Moderate Joe Biden” [Ruy Teixeira, The Liberal Patriot].

Trump will go on to do many evil things as president, just as he did during his first term, but none of this will reverse the fact that Biden just spent four years advancing genocide, nuclear brinkmanship and authoritarianism. The Democratic Party plays just as crucial a role in promoting the tyranny and abuses of the U.S. empire as the Republican Party does, and it is nonsensical to think of either of them as a lesser evil. The empire itself must end. It’s possible that Trump’s term will constitute another swing from Bush-level depravity to Obama-level depravity. It isn’t normal for the U.S. empire to be as openly depraved as it has been in Gaza. Normally its evils are much more well-disguised, because it is in the empire’s interests to preserve its image in the eyes of the western public. You only see the really in-your-face acts of monstrosity when a coalition of forces within the swamp are able to seize on a rare opportunity to shove them through, as we saw in the wake of 9/11 and again in the wake of Oct. 7. The rest of the time, the empire likes to be a lot subtler about its abuses, like it was during the Obama administration and the first Trump administration.” • One could, I suppose, consider engulfing Greenland as “subtle” compared to a full-blown war with China.

Realignment and Legitimacy “Trump rescinds Biden’s census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps” [NPR]. “Among the dozens of Biden-era executive orders that President Trump revoked on Monday was one that had reversed the first Trump administration’s unprecedented policy of altering a key set of census results. Since the first U.S. census in 1790, no resident has ever been omitted from those numbers because of immigration status. And after the Civil War, the 14th Amendment has called for the population counts that determine each state’s share of U.S. House seats and Electoral College votes to include the ‘whole number of persons in each state.’ Biden’s now-revoked 2021 order affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in each state in those census results. It was issued in response to Trump’s attempt during the national tally in 2020 to exclude millions of U.S. residents without legal status…. Though it had an opportunity during the first Trump administration, the Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether the president can exclude people who are in the country without legal status from the tally that determines political power in the United States.” • Well, when you frame it that way…    Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

September 2024. “This report introduces the Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS), which utilizes a multi-modal approach to enhance efficacy. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets from the air, and serving as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, while rapidly neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. The formulation consists of excipients identified from the FDA’s Inactive Ingredient Database and Generally Recognized as Safe list to maximize efficacy for each step in the multi-modal approach. PCANS demonstrates nasal retention for up to 8 hours in mice. In a severe Influenza A mouse model, a single pre-exposure dose of PCANS leads to a >99.99% reduction in lung viral titer and ensures 100% survival, compared to 0% in the control group. PCANS suppresses pathological manifestations and offers protection for at least 4 hours. This data suggest PCANS as a promising daily-use prophylactic against respiratory infections.” • Maybe one day it will be on sale…        Maskstravaganza If you are only permitted a surgical mask:  here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025   Here is one modification:  here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025   Here is another:  here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025   There are a lot more techniques; the thread is worth reading in full.   Vaccines “Former surgeon general: Vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major threat” [Jerome Adams, STAT]. The Biden Administration vaccine rollout was fantastically destructive, as we see here. “While there’s much to celebrate about the current focus on improving overall health — particularly the incoming administration’s emphasis on the MAHA agenda, which promotes better food safety, nutrition, and physical activity — it’s crucial that we remember these must be priorities in addition to addressing vaccine-preventable diseases, not in place of them. As I’ve said before, you can’t die of early heart disease at 50 if you already died from polio at 5. The reality is that vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major threat, even in the 21st century, and we ignore that at our peril. I hear from pediatricians and health officials across the country on a near-daily basis about their growing concerns over declining vaccination rates. Parents who would have once trusted their health care providers’ recommendations are now questioning vaccines that should be routine, like MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella). What’s even more troubling is that even the parents of long-term patients — children who have received all their vaccines in the past — are increasingly opting to delay or forgo these essential shots due to new doubts, often fueled by misinformation. What’s worse is that the default response to health provider recommendations has shifted. For many parents, the idea of questioning, deferring, or outright rejecting vaccines has become the norm, rather the exception. This undermines the trust that has been built over generations between health care providers and families, and presents a serious challenge for those of us trying to protect the health of all Americans, especially our children. The impact of this growing vaccine hesitancy will, of course, be felt most acutely by children whose parents are trying, in deeply misguided ways, to protect them. While we’re unlikely to see a dramatic rise in deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. in the near term, the personal costs are immense. A single case of measles can lead to weeks of missed school, sporting events, family gatherings, and other milestones. These are costs many Americans felt were unbearable and inexcusable during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet we’re now putting our children at risk of suffering the same disruptions — disruptions that are both preventable and unnecessary.” • As I said, it’s MMR that’s under-assault. Of course, we have already been induced to abandon our children to Covid — thanks, Great Barrington dudes — so everything’s going according to plan.

Reflections prompted by the Neil Gaiman case. “There’s a moment in the Gaiman exposé where the main accuser, Scarlett Pavlovich, sends him a text message asking him how he’s doing. Gaiman says he’s struggling: he’s heard from people close to him that Pavlovich plans to accuse him of rape. ‘I thought that we were a good thing and a very consensual thing indeed,’ he writes. ‘It was consensual (and wonderful)!” she replies. Except: she doesn’t mean it.” But: “[I]n the article we’ve been instructed, explicitly and repeatedly, that you can’t assume a relationship was consensual just because all parties involved gave consent.” And: “The thing is, if women can’t be trusted to assert their desires or boundaries because they’ll invariably lie about what they want in order to please other people, it’s not just sex they can’t reasonably consent to. It’s medical treatments. Car loans. Nuclear non-proliferation agreements. Our entire social contract operates on the premise that adults are strong enough to choose their choices, no matter the ambient pressure from horny men or sleazy used car salesmen or power-hungry ayatollahs. If half the world’s adult population are actually just smol beans — hapless, helpless, fickle, fragile, and much too tender to perform even the most basic self-advocacy — everything starts to fall apart, including the entire feminist project.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.\r\n\r\nTo me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Los Angeles County SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentration as a percentage of the Winter 2023-2024 peak concentration value: 12/7/24:   18%\n12/14/24:  19%\n12/21/24:  19%\n12/28/24:   24% http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/data/index.htm The value for the end of December probably represents the peak for the season. We can definitively say that this winter’s prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was only one-quarter of last year’s prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. It takes two weeks to get the lab results. “We can definitively say…” Based on what, exactly?  With all of the manipulation going on with Covid-19 data reporting I have exactly zero confidence in any such statements, regardless of the source. I wonder what the injured police at the Jan 6 riot think about the pardoning of their attackers? And how the families of those killed view $Trump’s pardons? Remind us who was killed on Jan 6, and how many were killed by protesters.   I lost count in all the confusion. I wonder how all those hundreds of thousands of family members of dead Ukrainians feel about Biden pre-pardoning his entire crime family to cover up the grifting they did to line their pockets at Ukrainian expense. This feels like “whataboutism”. Biden’s pardons can be wrong and Trump’s pardons can be wrong. “Whataboutism: is a term invented by the butthurt “liberals” in an attempt to make Trump out as the worst president evah.  It’s a term I reject.   I much prefer the term “context”, which is information needed in order to have an informed opinion.   In my informed opinion, Biden’s pardons, including the non-pardon of Leonard Peltier (he deserved a real pardon, not the half-assed “pardon” he got), are wrong.   While I don’t know the details of every single Jan 6th case, from what I do know of them, those pardons were the right thing to do.  Participating in a protest that turned into a riot that disrupted a procedural vote for a couple hours doesn’t warrant serious jail time or a black mark on anyone’s record.  I won’t even get into the fact that the capitol police let many of the protesters in, or how many spooks were in the crowd that day. The butthurt is at a fever pitch right now, and their tolerance is very low. They are incapable of informed opinions – all they feel is hate. They hate Trump, the people around him, and the people who voted for him. They are the scoundrels that did this to them and they want revenge. Even death, and yes, I have read that about some of the J6 people (death instead of pardons). It’s going to be a long 4 years. On fb I’m a member of a “city X before and after” photograph group. 22k members. It’s a neat group. Today the founder went off the rails about Trump and the J6 pardons. Went ballistic, irrational, completely unhinged. He totally blew the group up. Some people agreed with him and posted unhinged stuff as well. If this is what is going on with people…not a good sign. I screenshotted it. I’ll save you guys from the words used. Lots of familyblog. I have a similar thing too. They are at fever pitch hate level, and it’s getting very nasty. You are either like them, or you are the enemy. There is no middle ground – none. Absolutely what you said, Screwball. That is what that guy’s post was-all of what you said. Watch the video of the incident commander of the Capitol Police shooting an unarmed Woman to death, Ashli Babbitt.\nOne of the curious things about that shooting was the two Capitol cops standing by while rioters smashed the class partitions on either side of the door they were guarding.\nMs Babbitt crawled through one of those openings while the cops did nothing.It was t was murder in the 2nd degree, at NO POINT did Ms Babbitt pose a threat of death or serious bodily injury to anyone.\nLet me repeat, the cop who shot her dead was in charge of the Capitol police response that day.\nHe committed murder on camera, in front of numerous witnesses and he has not been charged for that crime. I watched that incident. I also saw him warning her as she and a small group were breaking down a barrier in the capital building. I wonder how the response would be seen if the president was behind that barrier and a small group were breaking d9en the door to get to them. You can reject whatever terms you want, but if you disagree that Trump’s pardons were wrong (I don’t really know enough to have a strong opinion), then disagree on the basis of those facts not on the basis of something a different president did. Hmmm . . . is beating up police officers not a crime if it is in what you consider a good cause? More than 600 were charged with assaulting, resisting or obstructing law enforcement, including around 175 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer, including with batons, planks, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bearer or pepper spray. Several were convicted of seditious conspiracy. If let’s say BLM protesters, or climate protesters had done a fraction of that, many of the Capitol rioters would probably be among those calling for them to be shipped to Gitmo. Thin blue line flag at the Capitol riot Some of the charges C’mon – it’s pretty clear they increased the charges to send a message and most should have been at worst charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor.  So write them a ticket and be done with it.   And BLM protesters did do a fraction of that, and I don’t think they should go to prison either.  I’m still a fan of that 1st amendment thing and try to be consistent.  I can’t speak for the hypothetical MAGAs out there, who increasingly seem to me to be a caricature created by scared “liberals”.  I didn’t vote for Trump, but I know plenty of people who did, and not many fit the stereotype the media would have you believe. Plenty of photographic evidence and sworn testimony of what happened was provided to judges and juries. We can all have opinions as to whether the cause of the protesters was just or their tactics justified, but what happened wasn’t only trespass.

You can dress up the thinnest tissue of behaviour by two or more people into a plan to bring down the state and a major indictment when the biggest choate crime on the facts might be a parking misdemeanour They increased the charges and used collective responsibility on a disorganised mass. This is what usually happens when cops riot, those who got their scull bashed gets prosecuted for being so threatening that the cops had to riot. Cops in turn tend to riot when control is slipping. And the courts tend to have their back.  The unusual thing here is that the cops hardly rioted and that the target is on the right. Otherwise it follows the basic model, which tend to apply no matter the form of government or formal rights to speech or assembly. If real power is threatened niceties goes out the window. I guess it’s all about the exception and who gets to decide the exception. The Associated Press has an interactive web page, Track the legal paths of those arrested in the Jan. 6/Capitol riots that goes into detail about the individuals involved, what they were charged with, their sentences, their states of residence and any group affiliations that they have.  Charges:\n674 – Illegal parading\n520 – Disorderly conduct\n350 – Entering restricted area\n238 – Assault\n180 – Obstructing official proceeding\n86 – Physical violence\n57 – Theft/Destruction of property\n18 – Conspiracy to obstruct official proceeding\n14 – Seditious conspiracy\n8 – Tampering with documents/proceedings\n5 – Firearms charge\n4 – Obstructing justice\n4 – Communicating threats\n3 – Obstructing officers\n2 – Robbery Sentences:\n1107 – Restitution\n1044 – Probation/Supervised release\n717 – Imprisonment\n464 – Community service\n297 – Fine\n251 – Home confinement Of the 1,573 people charge, most were not a part of any organized group: Affiliations:\n73 – Proud Boys\n32 – Oath Keepers\n27 – Three Percenters I wonder what the family of Ashley Bobbitt feels about the J6 committee being pardoned wholesale. How was the shooting of someone breaking down barred doors in the capital building and warned before being shot unjustified? Which government building should protesters be allowed to break down doors in? Copagandist.  Trespassing in a public space is death sentence for ya, Kurt?  Lovely. Having seen how many tear gas projectiles the police fired into peaceful protesters, I think most of the police involved and their families are deeply grateful to former President Biden for his last second pardons, immunizing them from perjury charges for their testimonies before the J6 Committee and in DC courts where they were allowed to testify even if there was no proof a defendant had been anywhere near that officer (raindrop theory).  The true J6 story will make Watergate look like a third rate burglary. I know many are not a fan of Tucker Carlson, me included, but his interview with the Capital Police guy was quite telling. Tucker did a nice job and shut his mouth for the most part. Raindrop theory expanded:  “When we are all guilty, we will have democracy.”\n—Albert Camus Zero people, excluding Mrs. Babbit (a protester) were killed that day. She was killed by a policeman with a very bad history of gun use. No police were killed. A few had minor injuries, mostly pepper spray. One cop died a few days later, of a heart attack. Read less fake news (unless you were being sarcastic). Re: “raindrop” theory of prosecution/J6 defendants I am constantly amazed at how liberals fail to understand that when you attack and abuse the law, it will be used against you by the other side in the future.   So at the next BLM/Occupy protest, some poor schmoe who holds a sign up peacefully can now be arrested for the crimes committed by the other dude who throws a rock through a store window.   Thanks Kollar-Ketelly, you’ve just given right-wing prosecutors a new tool to suppress freedom of expression. So at the next BLM/Occupy protest, some poor schmoe who holds a sign up peacefully can now be arrested for the crimes committed by the other dude who throws a rock through a store window.\n Mission accomplished! Yes, how silly of me to think that either side of the bench has any goal besides destroying freedom of speech and expression.  Thanks for correcting me. Chris,\nWelcome to the exciting world of direct action. You’ve clearly never been to any demonstration where police were released to beat up on participants (on the other hand, the startlingly few participants who dare to beat up on police or counter-demonstrators, even in self-defense, tend to die while resisting arrest). Raindrop theory is already routine. January 6th was the just the first time I’m aware of that it’s been applied to proto-fascist demonstrators in the United States. You also haven’t been tracking largely successful energy industry efforts to automatically deem anyone opposing them as terrorists, a practice that Trump will soon be expanding to anyone he doesn’t like and their families and friends. We are about to discover that “free” in TrumpWorld is a NewSpeak term, quite different from “free” as conventionally defined in any dictionary. It will be interesting to see how long it takes people to realize that they’ve been had. Again. Those weren’t raindrops in the GFC. And of course blac blockers will throw that brick and rock in hopes of getting every  poor schmoe arrested and maybe gassed and beaten and then maybe prosecuted . . . in order to radicalize them all and maybe recruit them into the blac block.    Depend upon that, too. Would it be fair to say his outstretched arm was elongated? Elon-gated…almost missed that! Brilliant! Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly…\nA Nazi to her very core. Loves her secret laws and secret rulings. I never see photos of Davosians skiing, why’s that? Maybe they just don’t do it.   Gives them too much of that Louis XVI feeling. Piste de la resistance? Shouldn’t that be Axial de Resistance?\n“Did you see that?”\n“Yes, I did. She turned on a euro!”\n“Amazing.” The ghost of Sonny Bono wants a word … Weather foecast the day Bono ate it… Cloudy in the morning, Sonny in the trees in the afternoon. Poikilotherms, all of them It’s for other people to bend ze knees?  Actually, it is funny you don’t see them skiing because they are always using the poles and looking for new moguls. they all feverishly watched the pink panther movie and thought it was historically accurate. That’s because all we have in the way of physical samples of the Davosonians are a finger bone and some pocket protectors. The conspiratorially inclined will be certain to become very verklempt over the original source of the evidence of the Davosonians; some obscure cave in central Russia. “Neo-Nazis Love the Nazi-Like Salutes Elon Musk Made at Trump’s Inauguration”  I made no immediate assumptions about Elon’s hand gesture because that is how I act in these days of automatic information. I said the same thing to myself, the hand on the heart first, I have never seen it. But I saw the same video as you of the neo-nazi’s saluting, and now I need to default that he holds their views unless he states otherwise. It convinced me. This, to me, is not something to be on the sidelines about. I know you need Twitter for a= much of your reporting here, but I wonder if there is something to be done about it. Things may be about to change and maybe more news will move off of Twitter now? I hope so, I use a service called xcancel to look at Twitter. Not trying to be a jerk.  Please look at any number of photos of public figures doing the same thing that are now circulating all over the Internet.  Including Kamala Harris.  I will point out it was the ADL themselves who wrote a Tweet last night basically saying “not so fast – we should focus on things that are actually anti-Semitic”.  I am of the mind that if anyone should be able to opine about this it would be them.  Every Holocaust survivor patient I have ever had has been in their group.  I am certain they would be able to recognize a real Nazi salute. My Jewish colleagues today in the lounge were just shaking their head in disbelief that AOC et al would be making an issue out of this. There are lots of things I do not like about Musk.  As has been usual the past 10 years or so, all of this kind of performative bullshit just completely takes the attention away from the real issues. I think the woke need to grow a pair.  Musk is clearly not a politician nor is he someone who is really comfortable in the limelight.  I myself do not get nervous at all in front of students.  In front of strangers I turn into Jello – and I have videos of myself through life doing all kinds of awkward things in public speeches. Your skirt is hiked up a bit, and your bias is showing. That is a personal attack and utterly out of line.  IM  Doc lives in a deep blue enclave and is reporting on what patients and colleagues are telling him. If they are not buying the Musk gesture hysteria and you are, the problem is YOU.  There are plenty of things to be worked up about re Musk, and this or should be low on the list if you were paying attention. Start with DOGE, FFS. And you will have no more return here. I thought AOC was being idiotic too.  What gets me is the hand-on-heart gesture. It seemed to me dispositive that Musk was “giving his heart” with that gesture (and Musk is, I said especially herky jerky in his motions just now, so the stiff arm arm didn’t bother me. But now, given that video, where the hand-on-heart movement, which is not part of the Roman salute at all, is part of the whole gesture, it looks to me like two populations caught the same variant. And I really dislike coming to that conclusion, because I hate that way of thinking. Adding, I’ll keep track of that video, let’s see what others say. It might have been a poor attempt at something like Steph Curry’s gesture. Musk is getting increasingly nuttier, but I don’t think he’s whacko enough to start giving the HH to large crowds in front of lots of cameras.  I could be wrong. The Ukrainians all think he’s on their side now. https://nitter.poast.org/MyLordBebo/status/1881753775289077818#m Also, not Musk but too funny to pass up, Trump allegedly trolling Hispanophone America. https://nitter.poast.org/MyLordBebo/status/1881791991677137342#m It could have the Techbro’s version of the Romulan ‘salute’ from the Star Trek program.\nSee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxnqqQLVTI&ab_channel=WickyWoo The Romulans didn’t do the outstretched hand, did they? I think it is more similar to the “Terran salute” from the mirror universe. Which is of course just a nazi salute. It is kind of wild to me to see the machinations people are going through to not see the obvious. The specifics of the sieg heil (was the hand laid flat on the chest, or held perpendicular to it?) is entirely besides the point. So he Americanized it a bit by adding a “hand over heart” a la the Pledge of Alliegance…and? That was a sieg heil, he did it twice, clear as day. Everyone downplaying it feels to me exactly like everyone trying to say Biden was fine, actually, after the debate. Bruh, we all saw it with our own eyes. No one does that by accident. And it also looked to me like he was coked or methed up pretty good, but I guess when you wrap up with a good ol’ fascist salute everything else kinda gets forgotten. Here is Musk in parallell with the original nazi salute. The arm moves in a simliar fashion, but Musks is a bit more forceful, while the original German is more stiff. Here is American history X with a neo-nazi salute. The neo-nazi, US version, is more forceful then the original and very similar to what Musk is doing. In other words: Musk did a nazi salute. Twice. While proclaiming that Trump voters had saved civilization. None of us can know what goes on in another persons head. But most people go their whole lifes while not doing a nazi salute in public, even once. I find it unlikely that Musk didn’t know what he was doing. About as unlikely as all those Ukrainians just happen to use symbols that are very similar to nazi symbols. Here’s a gif with Elon and Skinheads (the bad kind) side-by-side. It’s an exact match. https://discuss.smash.today/@SmashToday/113873210813104675 Those guys on the left look like undercover state agents provocateurs. Then again, so does the guy on the right. What else is AOC going to talk about now that she’s decided Pelosi is “Mama Bear”? Selling out limits your options. Amen, to your second sentence. Imo. Woke is the same kind of busybody collection for liberals that the Moral Majority busybody collection was for conservatives back in the day: Social authoritarianism disguised as do-gooderism.  ‘Believe what I believe or else.’ The spirit of Mrs. Grundy lives! Casting Musk’s ‘heart-felt’ salute as ‘Nazi’ helps to further tar AFD with the same brush. As it should. AfD is fascist. Full stop. So are most ruling parties in the EU/NATO. I take disagreements with compassion.  The photos you are referring too are photos, but with Musk, it was a video.  And he did not do it once, but twice.  Mostly I am just saying it is not as certain as it was when I first saw the video. The ADL thinks anti-zionism is anti-semitism, so I cannot take their opinion seriously. But the ADL criticized AfD saying: AfD members were exposed as participants in a November 2023 secret meeting of far-right extremists in Potsdam, including Austrian neo-Nazi Martin Sellner, who discussed a mass deportation plan for foreigners and “non-assimilated” Germans, as part of AfD’s strategy should it be elected to govern Germany. Musk expressed support of the AfD. I would not support the AfD. And the only real response Musk gave was: “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” But no on is calling him Hitler, they are calling him a neo-nazi.  I can see that he might have done it on purpose to stir up this very tempest, but I am airing on the side of extreme caution here. “I can see that he might have done it on purpose to stir up this very tempes” I think it almost certainly is that. To me it looked a bit off (hand angled a little high), like he was either trying to make a Nazi salute and failing or making a gesture guaranteed to be taken for a Nazi salute with a slight deviation for the sake of deniability. Then again, looking at old photos of actual Nazi salutes, it’s not like they always held their hands in exactly the same way, so maybe it fits. What I find truly unlikely, though, is that someone like Musk would be able to hold consistently to a demanding ideology like Nazism for any amount of time. What I find extremely likely is that someone like Musk would make a pathetically successful attempt to stir up a controversy by violating widespread taboos and trolling the left. As far as I could tell, it’s one of his favourite activities. Ideologies are for plebs. Insanely rich ego-maniacs only worship themselves. I’m not sure the even he knew why he did it. Maybe he felt that he is now on top of the world, like some modern day Roman Emperor. Avē Caesar! Be careful Doc, I wouldn’t get too comfortable with the ADL’s efforts to point out “real” antisemitism. My take is that they were encouraging people to back off on the Musk salute only to make a larger point about antisemitism, not to actually dial it back to a sensible level. The ADL makes it clear throughout their website that they support a broad definition of antisemitism, including boycotts against the Israeli state and comparison to apartheid and nazi regimes. Musk says he’s on the Asperger spectrum. That means he lacks “social skills”. I.e. he can’t figure out how normies will misinterpret what he does. Here he is, a 50 year old man prancing around like a giddy 10 year old, and people don’t take that into account and think he’s the next incarnation of Hitler? I sometimes wish I could send people here to totalitarian states so that they learn what totalitarianism is once and for all, and realize they don’t live in one. Six month school exchanges with North Korea might finally knock some sense into them. “Here he is, a 50 year old man prancing around like a giddy 10 year old” Sounds like just the right person to be advising Trump. I disagree. You can be socially skilled and very stupid. Witness many politicians… Boris Johnson, Macron & Sarkozy come to my mind, but I’m sure everyone else has their own version. You can also be socially awkward and very intelligent. Witness many mathematicians, scientists and engineers, eg Einstein, Newton, Tesla, Turing, Feynman, Nash, Faraday, Pascal, Mendel, Schrödinger… etc. I think Musk falls into the latter category. As such, he might be useful advising on tech matters. I’m not sure what he’ll do with DOGE. It could be a disaster, but on the other hand Twitter still works despite his firing of tons of employees, so he knew what to cut. Time will tell. Does Twitter still work despite the firings? I can’t see replies or full threads anymore if I’m not logged in, and that was a big part of the site. Also, about 30% of the time, I just get stuck in a loop for days where the login page will just wrap around on itself and not let me log in. The functionality ain’t what it used to be. Does Twitter still work despite the firings? I can’t see replies or full threads anymore if I’m not logged in, and that was a big part of the site. Unfortunately, I think that’s a commercial decision (aka enshitiffication)  to force people to log in. Twitter downtime is down (Twitter whales). No idea about your login issue. I have no idea what makes you place Musk into the same category as Einstein, et al.  He has failed to demonstrate his genius, is not an engineer, and routinely confuses ideas he stole from others as his own.  His claim of being on the spectrum is pure BS. He’s a conman and a grifter, not a real world Tony Stark / Iron Man. The category is intelligent but socially awkward people. Name me someone else who developed reusable rockets. AFAIK he did quite a bit of the work on that himself. Name me someone else who developed the level of self-driving that Tesla has. Sure, he relies on engineers to help do this, but he has made major decisions about it. So did Edison. If you don’t think that requires intelligence, why don’t you do it? Name me someone else who developed reusable rockets. AFAIK he did quite a bit of the work on that himself.  McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X  ? Interesting, thanks. I learned something. To be fair though, it was a prototype that never reached space, rather than a production vehicle launching satellites. Apparently Musk said “the SpaceX Falcon 9 development was “… continuing the great work of the DC-X project”. To be fair, Musk is still failing to make much headway with Starship.  Multiple failures yet no stable low Earth orbit tests.  Getting the rocket booster back sometimes, but frequently losing the main flight stage hardly makes it much better than the DC-X. Feel free to point to one thing Musk developed himself, instead of buying, that was successful. He’s bought everything he’s ever sold. It’s not intelligence, it’s money! Because I don’t have the money. Intelligence has nothing to do with it. LOL, you are actually dismissing engineers as some irrelevant factor in engineering. Like they are janitors, or maybe nurses wiping sweat of a surgeon performing open heart surgery. As an engineer, I almost feel personally insulted. Those guys are the ones doing all the work that you are supposedly praising here (the rocket science stuff), and I bet you can’t name a single one of them (or any real rocket scientist for that matter). Instead, you are worshiping the CEO celebrity guy. What Edison did was cheating and stealing, and also killing animals in public for marketing reasons. I bet you love him too. I’m an engineer too, and I’m quite aware that without a company in which one can develop cool stuff, what one does doesn’t get anywhere. That company is a machine too, and that’s what Elon builds. But let’s just ignore that, and pretend he just bought it all, and is dumb. Just ask yourself, if he had supported the people you like, would you be singing the same tune? What people I like? I don’t like people at all. Why would I pretend stuff? I feel like you and I live in two different universes. How about we just ignore that I tried to establish inter-universe communication. Your last sentence gives an explanation for the first one. He’s a conman and a grifter, and an essential part of it is to make people place Musk into the same category as Einstein. In real life, his placement is different, but some people are more inclined to belive his words than their own lying eyes.\nhttps://x.com/DD_Geopolitics/status/1881541689585852882 ADL is not an authority on fascism.  Hitler’s most infamous demon of choice was Jews (as opposed to, say, Mexicans or Haitians or Palestinians), something that even fellow-fascists like Mussolini never took seriously at the time.\nHitler worshippers are fascists. But not all fascists worship Hitler. Don’t believe someone is a Nazi until the ADL deny it.  When fascism comes to America, it will come in the guise of anti-antisemitism.  Musk is clearly a man of the radical right, not just a typical libertarian (Koch type) or evangelical Christian billionaire. A normal billionaire is content to buy influence and stay behind the scenes. Musk has become an ideological warrior. He likes warring and it has pushed him into some truly weird rightwing subcultures. He’s also on who knows what substances. ADL said that AZOV are not Nazis too.\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2022/12/08/adl-ukraines-azov-battalion-far-right/ ADL is nothing more that an attack dog for those that do not stay in line (by playing insta-win anti-Semitic card), and guard for those that are part of their gang (which Azov, and Musk, demonstratively are). I wonder if your Jewish colleagues think that there are no Nazis in Ukraine. People using ADL, or “Jewish people they met”, as a reference for anything is not even funny anymore. This whole incident is not about Musk, but about the whole US public discourse. I saw one of those still photos of Kamala Harris.    Then I saw this little video bit which that still photo was artfully extracted from.   Here is the video bit.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1i6szwa/context_for_those_sharing_kamala_still_images/    I wonder how many of those any number of other photos of public figures doing the same thing were also artfully extracted from videos showing them doing no such thing at all.    Clevery extracted by complete-bad-faith-based clever extracters and sight-biters.    And I wonder how many fake photoshop “pictures” will follow along, pretending to show nazi salutes from various public figures. > maybe more news will move off of Twitter now? I hope so, As of today there is nothing of equivalent scale or scope, both for breaking stories, Covid, and various vertical “neighborhoods,” certainly not Threads or Bluesky. What would be ideal is the rejuvenation of the blogosphere. Thanks to Kneecap I now read a lot of Irish reddit sub’s. They are all chock full of posts demanding that X links be banned (screenshots allowed by the more permissive). This is the cynical, tolerant Irish. These people need help!

This article gave me a hint of why.  Is this a thing? *giggle..”I’m just a girl! ” giggle* First was a waitress when asked a question about cars during our conversation about my kid putting his car in a ditch.  The implication was that she can’t know anything about cars because she’s just a girl. The second was an over heard social conversation at work between male and female co-workers, both in their 20’s and the young lady’s phrasing and intonation were identical to the waitress.  I’m almost 60 so I’m totally out of touch. Was this the intonation? If so, it’s just a self-deprecating pop-culture reference.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftde81QNXDY It was close to this…I hope that is all it is. Oh man i actually have read a lot of pieces on the self infantilization of women in their 20s.

Ruy Teixeira evidently inhabits an alternate universe — one where Biden was too progressive. Evidence? From where I sit he was the desperation candidate to prevent Bernie from winning the nomination in 2019: recall the other candidates — with the exception of Warren, who was the nearest to Bernie’s right— all magically dropping out just before South Carolina. Coincidence? Hardly.  And when he won in 2020 the donor class found him usefully malleable, so they hung onto his increasingly obvious cognitively decayed carcass like grim death until the debate exposed the charade. Too progressive? What a bad joke … Ruy Teixeira’s account of 2020 completely omits Obama’s involvement in selecting Biden. He then goes on to cite Third Way. I had some hope that he was’t a sleazy opportunist. Fat chance! About the executive orders — wondering if anyone has considered using AI to analyze them – especially for the comparison against Project 2025. It seems to me that’s the kind of task that LLMs like Claude have been designed for. I’d volunteer for a working group, but it would help to have people with a background in the subject matter to fine-tune the prompting. About the executive orders — wondering if anyone has considered using AI to analyze them – especially for the comparison against Project 2025… [ Excellent.  This is precisely the sort of analysis that a proper AI system is meant for. ] A different perspective from the one you suggest but here are some takes on AI and copy-paste in the EO’s. https://bsky.app/profile/mjsdc.bsky.social/post/3lg7uvbogds27\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/rmfifthcircuit.bsky.social/post/3lg7t4h4n6c22 Generative AI seems like overkill, unreliable, and it has quite a bad track record of “hallucinating” citations. This is just basic textual analysis. If you want to use an app, you could put all the documents into a single folder and start searching for set phrases using double quotes. On macOS, you can easily do this with the Finder, and even create compound searches. If there’s any duplication or copy-and-paste between Project 2025 and the EOs, you’ll find it soon enough. P.S., Yves has spoken out against citing AI apps as sources here, and I agree that’s a sound policy. Mask tweet Threadreader here: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1880437952729518482.html Thank you! About the Gulf-of-Mexico coast blizzard being a once in a lifetime event . . . I don’t think so.   As man-made global heatering keeps destabilizing the atmosphere and the jet streams, I expect more random and deeper-reaching herniated polar vortexes here and there than what we used to have.     That means storm events “like” this every few years or so.   More zuds in Mongolia ( https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146422 )\nmore blizzards in the Gulf of MexiComerica, etc.    This is an opportunity for all the California-sympathetic Senators and Representatives to keep careful note of which Senators and Representatives vote against fire disaster relief for California, so they can vote against disaster relief when the Senators and Representatives from those states or districts want some post-disaster relief assistance for their states or districts. I don’t suppose that this is going to delay all those LNG shipments to the EU as the EU has left themselves on the hook for needing them now. No, it certainly won’t.   And after global warming has advanced enough to cancel the  Gulf Stream and  turn EUrope into a localized super-cold zone every winter, they will buy even more mucher morer LNG than now.    Profits! I’m of the opinion that much of the truly weird weather is on account of Hunga Tonga blowing up real good in 2022-combined with climate change. Clowns like Johnson making conditions for California will come back to bite him when push>meets<shove in his back yard. Only if California and others MAKE it come back to bite Johnson in the back yard.  In fact, if all the delegations opposed to Johnson’s MAGA behavior here want to, they will promise ahead of time to vote against any relief for the South from this weather unless and until no-conditions relief for California has been voted through and signed by President Musk(trump).
